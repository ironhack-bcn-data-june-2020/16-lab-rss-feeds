This means correct in the sense of not having any runtime errors, but also correct in actually doing what the programmer intended it to do. To accomplish this, Dafny relies on high-level annotations to reason about and prove correctness of code. The effect of a piece of code can be given abstractly, using a natural, high-level expression of the desired behavior, which is easier and less error prone to write. Dafny then generates a proof that the code matches the annotations (assuming they are correct, of course!). Dafny lifts the burden of writing bug-free code into that of writing bug-free annotations.

It sounds simplistic to state that AI product managers should develop and ship products that improve metrics the business cares about. Though these concepts may be simple to understand, they aren’t as easy in practice. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>Agreeing on metrics</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s often difficult for businesses without a mature data or machine learning practice to define and agree on metrics. Politics, personalities, and the tradeoff between short-term and long-term outcomes can all contribute to a lack of alignment. Many companies face a problem that’s even worse: no one knows which levers contribute to the metrics that impact business outcomes, or which metrics are important to the company (such as those reported to Wall Street by publicly-traded companies). Rachel Thomas writes about these challenges in “<a href=\"https://www.fast.ai/2019/09/24/metrics/\">The problem with metrics is a big problem for AI</a>.” There isn’t a simple fix for these problems, but for new companies, investing early in understanding the company’s metrics ecosystem will pay dividends in the future.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The worst case scenario is when a business doesn’t have any metrics. In this case, the business probably got caught up in the hype about AI, but hasn’t done any of the preparation. (Fair warning: if the business lacks metrics, it probably also lacks discipline about data infrastructure, collection, governance, and much more.) Work with senior management to design and align on appropriate metrics, and make sure that executive leadership agrees and consents to using them before starting your experiments and developing your AI products in earnest. Getting this kind of agreement is much easier said than done, particularly because a company that doesn’t have metrics may never have thought seriously about what makes their business successful. It may require intense negotiation between different divisions, each of which has its own procedures and its own political interests. As Jez Humble said in a<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity/devops-web-performance-2015\"> Velocity Conference</a> training session, “Metrics should be painful: metrics should be able to make you change what you’re doing.” Don’t expect agreement to come simply.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Lack of clarity about metrics is technical debt worth paying down. Without clarity in metrics, it’s impossible to do meaningful experimentation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>Ethics</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A product manager needs to think about ethics–and encourage the product team to think about ethics–throughout the whole product development process, but it’s particularly important when you’re defining the problem.&nbsp; Is it a problem that should be solved?&nbsp; How can the solution be abused? Those are questions that every product team needs to think about.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There’s a substantial literature about ethics, data, and AI, so rather than repeat that discussion, we’ll leave you with a few resources.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ethics-and-data/9781492043898/\">Ethics and Data Science</a> is a short book that helps developers think through data problems, and includes a checklist that team members should revisit throughout the process. The Markkula Institute at the University of Santa Clara has an excellent list of <a href=\"https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/\">resources</a>, including an <a href=\"https://www.scu.edu/ethics-app/\">app</a> to aid ethical decision-making. The <a href=\"https://ethicalos.org/\">Ethical OS</a> also provides excellent tools for thinking through the impact of technologies.&nbsp; And finally–build a team that includes people of different backgrounds, and who will be affected by your products in different ways. It’s surprising (and saddening) how many ethical problems could have been avoided if more people thought about how the products would be used. AI is a powerful tool: use it for good.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Addressing the problem</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Once you know which metrics are most important, and which levers affect them, <em>you need to run experiments</em> to be sure that the AI products you want to develop actually map to those business metrics. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Experiments allow AI PMs not only to test assumptions about the relevance and functionality of AI Products, but also to understand the effect (if any) of AI products on the business. AI PMs must ensure that experimentation occurs during three phases of the product lifecycle:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol><li><strong>Phase 1: Concept</strong><br>During the concept phase, it’s important to determine if it’s even possible for an AI product “<a href=\"https://medium.com/recombee-blog/personalized-push-notifications-enabled-by-artificial-intelligence-8ac057bc97ba\">intervention</a>” to move an upstream business metric.&nbsp; Qualitative experiments, including research surveys and sociological studies, can be very useful here.<br><br>For example, many companies use recommendation engines to boost sales. But if your product is highly specialized, customers may come to you knowing what they want, and a recommendation engine just gets in the way. Experimentation should show you how your customers use your site, and whether a recommendation engine would help the business.<br></li><li><strong>Phase 2: Pre-deployment</strong><br>In the pre-deployment phase, it’s essential to ensure that <a href=\"https://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/adf0853-dengA.pdf\">certain metrics thresholds</a> are not violated by the core functionality of the AI product. These measures are commonly referred to as <a href=\"https://medium.com/@SplitSoftware/papers-we-love-lessons-learned-from-microsoft-and-yahoo-product-experimentation-experts-a4275ebfd1a\">guardrail metrics</a>, and they ensure that the product analytics aren’t giving decision-makers the wrong signal about what’s actually important to the business.<br><br>For example, a business metric for a rideshare company might be to reduce pickup time per user; the guardrail metric might be to maximize trips per user. An AI product could easily reduce average pickup time by dropping requests from users in hard-to-reach locations. However, that action would result in negative business outcomes for the company overall, and ultimately slow adoption of the service. If this sounds fanciful, it’s not hard to find AI systems that took inappropriate actions because they optimized a poorly thought-out metric. The guardrail metric is a check to ensure that an AI doesn’t make a “mistake.”<br><br>When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\">Goodhart’s Law</a>). Any metric can and will be abused.&nbsp; It is useful (and fun) for the development team to brainstorm creative ways to game the metrics, and think about the unintended side-effects this might have.&nbsp; The PM just needs to gather the team and ask “Let’s think about how to abuse the pickup time metric.”&nbsp; Someone will inevitably come up with “To minimize pickup time, we could just drop all the rides to or from distant locations.” Then you can think about what guardrail metrics (or other means) you can use to keep the system working appropriately.<br></li><li><strong>Phase 3: Post-deployment</strong><br>After deployment, the product needs to be instrumented to ensure that it continues to behave as expected, without harming other systems. Ongoing monitoring of critical metrics is yet another form of experimentation. AI performance tends to degrade over time as the environment changes. You can’t stop watching metrics just because the product has been deployed.<br><br>For example, an AI product that helps a clothing manufacturer understand which materials to buy will become stale as fashions change. If the AI product is successful, it may even cause those changes. You must detect when the model has become stale, and retrain it as necessary.</li></ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>Fault Tolerant Versus Fault Intolerant AI Problems</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>AI product managers need to understand how sensitive their project is to error. This isn’t always simple, since it doesn’t just take into account technical risk; it also has to account for social risk and reputational damage. As we mentioned in the <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/what-you-need-to-know-about-product-management-for-ai/\">first article</a> of this series, an AI application for product recommendations can make a lot of mistakes before anyone notices (ignoring concerns about bias); this has business impact, of course, but doesn’t cause life-threatening harm. On the other hand, an autonomous vehicle really can’t afford to make any mistakes; even if the autonomous vehicle is safer than a human driver, you (and your company) will take the blame for any accidents.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Planning and managing the project</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>AI PMs have to make tough choices when deciding where to apply limited resources. It’s the old “choose two” rule, where the parameters are Speed, Quality, and Features. For example, for a mobile phone app that uses object detection to identify pets, speed is a requirement. A product manager may sacrifice either a more diverse set of animals, or the accuracy of detection algorithms.&nbsp; These decisions have dramatic implications on project length, resources, and goals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/fig_01-1048x400.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13174\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/fig_01-1048x400.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/fig_01-300x114.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/fig_01-768x293.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/fig_01.png 1235w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 1: The &#8220;choose two&#8221; rule</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Similarly, AI product managers often need to choose whether to prioritize the scale and impact of a product over the difficulty of product development.&nbsp; Years ago a health and fitness technology company realized that its content moderators, used to manually detect and remediate offensive content on its platform, were experiencing extreme fatigue and very poor mental health outcomes.&nbsp; Even beyond the humane considerations, moderator burnout was a serious product issue, in that the company’s platform was rapidly growing, thus exposing the average user to more potentially offensive or illegal content.&nbsp; The difficulty of content moderation work was exacerbated by its repetitive nature, making it a candidate for automation via AI.&nbsp; However, the difficulty of developing a robust content moderation system at the time was significant, and would have required years of development time and research. Ultimately, the company decided to simply drop the most social components of the platform, a decision which limited overall growth. This tradeoff between impact and development difficulty is particularly relevant for products based on deep learning: breakthroughs often lead to unique, defensible, and highly lucrative products, but investing in products with a high chance of failure is an obvious risk. Products based on deep learning can be difficult (or even impossible) to develop; it’s a classic “high return versus high risk” situation, in which it is inherently difficult to calculate return on investment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The final major tradeoff that AI product managers must evaluate is how much time to spend during the R&amp;D and design phases.&nbsp; With no restrictrictions on release dates, PMs and engineers alike would choose to spend as much time as necessary to nail the product goals. But in the real world, products need to ship, and there’s rarely enough time to do the research necessary to ship the best possible product. Therefore, product managers must make a judgment call about when to ship, and that call is usually based on incomplete experimental results. It’s a balancing act, and admittedly, one that can be very tricky: achieving the product’s goals versus getting the product out there. As with traditional software, the best way to achieve your goals is to put something out there and iterate. This is particularly true for AI products. <a href=\"https://exp-platform.com/experiments-at-microsoft/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/making-the-linkedin-experimentation-engine-20x-faster\">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href=\"https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/https-medium-com-jonathan-parks-scaling-erf-23fd17c91166\">Airbnb</a> have been especially candid about their journeys towards building an experiment-driven culture and the technology required to support it. Some of the best lessons are captured in Ron Kohavi, Diane Tang, and Ya Xu’s book: <a href=\"https://experimentguide.com/\">Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments : A Practical Guide to A/B Testing</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The AI Product Development Process</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The development phases for an AI project map nearly 1:1 to the AI Product Pipeline we described in the <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/practical-skills-for-the-ai-product-manager/\">second article</a> of this series. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/fig_02-1048x731.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13175\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/fig_02-1048x731.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/fig_02-300x209.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/fig_02-768x536.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/fig_02.png 1180w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption>Figure 2: CRISP-DM aligned with AI Pipeline</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>AI projects require a “feedback loop” in both the product development process and the AI products themselves. Because AI products are inherently research-based, experimentation and iterative development are necessary. Unlike traditional software development, in which the inputs and results are often deterministic, the AI development cycle is probabilistic. This requires several important modifications to how projects are set up and executed, regardless of the project management framework.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Understand the Customer and Objectives</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Product managers must ensure that AI projects gather qualitative information about customer behavior. Because it might not be intuitive, it’s important to note that traditional data measurement tools are more effective at measuring <em>magnitude</em> than <em>sentiment</em>. For most AI products, the product manager will be less interested in the click-through rate (CTR) and other quantitative metrics than they are in the utility of the AI product to the user. Therefore, traditional product research teams must engage with the AI team to ensure that the correct intuition is applied to AI product development, as AI practitioners are likely to lack the appropriate skills and experience. CTRs are easy to measure, but if you build a system designed to optimize these kinds of metrics, you might find that the system sacrifices actual usefulness and user satisfaction. In this case, no matter how well the AI product contributes to such metrics, it’s output won’t ultimately serve the goals of the company.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s easy to focus on the wrong metric if you haven’t done the proper research. One mid-sized digital media company we interviewed reported that their Marketing, Advertising, Strategy, and Product teams once wanted to build an AI-driven user traffic forecast tool. The Marketing team built the first model, but because it was from marketing, the model optimized for CTR and lead conversion. The Advertising team was more interested in cost per lead (CPL) and lifetime value (LTV), while the Strategy team was aligned to corporate metrics (revenue impact and total active users).&nbsp; As a result, many of the tool’s users were dissatisfied, even though the AI functioned perfectly. The ultimate result was the development of multiple models that optimize for different metrics, and the redesign of the tool so that it could present those outputs clearly and intuitively to different kinds of users.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Internally, AI PMs must engage stakeholders to ensure alignment with the most important decision-makers and top-line business metrics. Put simply, no AI product will be successful if it never launches, and no AI product will launch unless the project is sponsored, funded, and connected to important business objectives.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Data Exploration and Experimentation</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This phase of an AI project is laborious and time consuming, but completing it is one of the strongest indicators of future success. A product needs to balance the investment of resources against the risks of moving forward without a full understanding of the data landscape. Acquiring data is often difficult, especially in regulated industries. Once relevant data has been obtained, understanding what is valuable and what is simply noise requires statistical and scientific rigor.&nbsp; AI product managers probably won’t do the research themselves; their role is to guide data scientists, analysts, and domain experts towards a product-centric evaluation of the data, and to inform meaningful experiment design. The goal is to have a measurable signal for what data exists, solid insights into that data’s relevance, and a clear vision of where to concentrate efforts in designing features.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Data Wrangling and Feature Engineering</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Data wrangling and feature engineering is the most difficult and important phase of every AI project.&nbsp; It’s generally accepted that, during a typical product development cycle, <a href=\"https://www.darkhorseanalytics.com/blog/the-value-is-in-the-data-wrangling\">80% of a data scientist’s time is spent in feature engineering</a>. Trends and tools in AutoML and Deep Learning have certainly reduced the time, skills, and effort required to build a prototype, if not an actual product.&nbsp; Nonetheless, building a superior feature pipeline or model architecture will always be worthwhile. AI product managers should make sure project plans account for the time, effort, and people needed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Modeling and Evaluation</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The modeling phase of an AI project is frustrating and difficult to predict. The process is inherently iterative, and some AI projects fail (for good reason) at this point. It’s easy to understand what makes this step difficult: there is rarely a sense of steady progress towards a goal. You experiment until something works; that might happen on the first day, or the hundredth day. An AI product manager must motivate the team members and stakeholders when there is no tangible “product” to show for everyone’s labor and investment.&nbsp; One strategy for maintaining motivation is to push for short-term bursts to beat a performance baseline. Another would be to start multiple threads (possibly even multiple projects), so that some will be able to demonstrate progress.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Deployment</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Unlike traditional software engineering projects, AI product managers must be heavily involved in the build process. Engineering managers are usually responsible for making sure all the components of a software product are properly compiled into binaries, and for organizing build scripts meticulously by version to ensure reproducibility. Many mature DevOps processes and tools, honed over years of successful software product releases, make these processes more manageable, but they were developed for traditional software products. The equivalent tools and processes simply do not exist in the ML/AI ecosystem; when they do, they are rarely mature enough to use at scale. As a result, AI PMs must take a high-touch, customized approach to guiding AI products through production, deployment, and release.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Monitoring</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Like any other production software system, after an AI product is live it must be monitored. However, for an AI product, both model performance <em>and</em> application performance must be monitored simultaneously. Alerts that are triggered when the AI product performs out of specification may need to be routed differently; the in-place SRE team may not be able to diagnose technical issues with the model or data pipelines without support from the AI team.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Though it’s difficult to create the “perfect” project plan for monitoring, it’s important for AI PMs to ensure that project resources (especially engineering talent) aren’t immediately released when the product has been deployed.&nbsp; Unlike a traditional software product, it’s hard to define when an AI product has been deployed successfully.&nbsp; The development process is iterative, and it’s not over after the product has been deployed–though, post-deployment, the stakes are higher, and your options for dealing with issues are more limited.&nbsp; Therefore, members of the development team must remain on the maintenance team to ensure that there is proper instrumentation for logging and monitoring the product’s health, and to ensure that there are resources available to deal with the inevitable problems that show up after deployment. (We call this “debugging” to distinguish it from the evaluation and testing that takes place during product development. The final article in this series will be devoted to debugging.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Among operations engineers, the idea of <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/monitoring-and-observability-whats-the-difference-and-why-does-it-matter/\">observability</a> is gradually replacing monitoring.&nbsp; Monitoring requires you to predict the metrics you need to watch in advance.&nbsp; That ability is certainly important for AI products–we’ve talked all along about the importance of metrics.&nbsp; Observability is critically different.&nbsp; Observability is the ability to get the information you need to understand why the system behaved the way it does; it’s less about measuring known quantities, and more about the ability to diagnose “unknown unknowns.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Executing on an AI Product Roadmap</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We’ve spent a lot of time talking about planning.&nbsp; Now let’s shift gears and discuss what’s needed to build a product.&nbsp; After all, that’s the point.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>AI Product Interface Design</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The AI product manager must be a member of the design team from the start, ensuring that the product provides the desired outcomes. It’s important to account for the ways a product will be used. In the best AI products, users can’t tell how the underlying models impact their experience. They neither know or care that there is AI in the application. Take <a href=\"https://www.stitchfix.com/\">Stitch Fix</a>, which uses a multitude of algorithmic approaches to provide customized style recommendations. When a Stitch Fix user interacts with its AI products, they interface with the prediction and recommendation engines. The information they interact with during that experience is an AI product–but they neither know, nor care, that AI is behind everything they see. If the algorithm makes a perfect prediction, but the user can’t imagine wearing the items they’re shown, the product is still a failure. In reality, ML models are far from perfect, so it is even more imperative to nail the user experience.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To do so, product managers must ensure that design gets an equal seat at the table with engineering.&nbsp; Designers are more attuned to qualitative research about user behavior.&nbsp; What signals show user satisfaction?&nbsp; How do you build products that delight users? Apple’s sense of design, making things that “just work,” pioneered through the iPod, iPhone, and iPad products is the foundation of their business.&nbsp; That’s what you need, and you need that input from the beginning.&nbsp; Interface design isn’t an after-the-fact add-on.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Picking the Right Scope</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Creeping featurism” is a problem with any software product, but it’s a particularly dangerous problem for AI. Focus your product development effort on problems that are relevant to the business and consumer. A successful AI product measurably (and positively) impacts metrics that matter to the business. Therefore, limit the scope of an AI product to features that can create this impact. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To do so, start with a well-framed hypothesis that, upon validation through experimentation, will produce meaningful outcomes. Doing this effectively means that AI PMs must learn to translate business intuitions into product development tools and processes. For example, if the business seeks to understand more about its customer base in order to maximize lifetime value for a subscription product, an AI PM would do well to understand the tools available for customer and product-mix segmentation, recommendation engines, and time-series forecasting. Then, when it comes to developing the AI product roadmap, the AI PM can focus engineering and AI teams on the <em>right experiments</em>, <em>the correct outcomes</em>,andthe<em> smoothest path to production</em>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It is tempting to over-value the performance gains achieved through the use of more complex modeling techniques, leading to the dreaded “black box” problem: models for which it’s difficult (if not impossible) to understand the relationship between the input and the output. Black box models are seldom useful in business environments for several reasons. First, being able to <a href=\"https://www.aiforpeople.org/tools-for-explainability-and-transparency/\">explain how the model works</a> is often a prerequisite for executive approval. Ethical and regulatory considerations often require a detailed understanding of the data, derived features, pipelines and scoring mechanisms involved in the AI system. Solving problems with the simplest model possible is always preferable, and not just because it leads to models that are interpretable. In addition, simpler modeling approaches are more likely to be supported by a wide variety of frameworks, data platforms, and languages, increasing interoperability and decreasing technical debt.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another scoping consideration concerns the processing engine that will power the product. Problems that are real-time (or near real-time) in nature can only be addressed by highly performant stream processing architectures. Examples of this include product recommendations in e-commerce systems or AI-enabled messaging. Stream processing requires significant engineering effort, and it’s important to account for that effort at the beginning of development. Some machine learning approaches (and many software engineering practices) are simply not appropriate for near-real time applications. If the problem at hand is more flexible and less interactive (such as offline churn probability prediction), batch processing is probably a good approach, and is typically easier to integrate with the average data stack.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Prototypes and Data Product MVPs</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Entrepreneurial product managers are often associated with the phrase “Move Fast and Break Things.”&nbsp; AI product mangers live and die by “Experiment Fast So You <em>Don’t</em> Break Things Later.”&nbsp; Take any social media company that sells advertisements. The timing, quantity, and type of ads displayed to segments of a company’s user population are overwhelmingly determined by algorithms. Customers contract with the social media company for a certain fixed budget, expecting to achieve certain audience exposure thresholds that can be measured by relevant business metrics. The budget that is actually spent successfully is referred to as <em>fulfillment</em>, and is directly related to the revenue that each customer generates. Any change to the underlying models or data ecosystem, such as how certain demographic features are weighted, can have a dramatic impact on the social media company’s revenue. Experimenting with new models is essential–but so is yanking an underperforming model out of production. This is only one example of why rapid prototyping is important for teams building AI products. AI PMs must create an environment in which continuous experimentation and failure are allowed (even celebrated), along with supporting the processes and tools that enable experimentation and learning through failure.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In a previous section, we introduced the importance of user research and interface design.&nbsp; Qualitative data collection tools (such as <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/\">SurveyMonkey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.qualtrics.com/\">Qualtrics</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/forms/about/\">Google Forms</a>) should be joined with interface prototyping tools (such as <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/\">Invision</a> and <a href=\"https://balsamiq.com/\">Balsamiq</a>), and with data prototyping tools (such as <a href=\"https://jupyter.org/install\">Jupyter Notebooks</a>) to form an ecosystem for product development and testing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Once such an environment exists, it’s important for the product manager to codify what constitutes a “minimum viable” AI product (MVP). This product should be robust enough to be used for user research and quantitative (model evaluation) experimentation, but simple enough that it can be quickly discarded or adjusted in favor of new iterations. And, while the word “minimum” is important, don’t forget “viable.” An MVP needs to be a product that can stand on its own, something that customers will want and use. If the product isn’t “viable” (i.e., if a user wouldn’t want it) you won’t be able to conduct good user research. Again, it’s important to listen to data scientists, data engineers, software developers, and design team members when deciding on the MVP.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Data Quality and Standardization</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In most organizations, Data Quality is either an engineering or IT problem; it is rarely addressed by the product team until it blocks a downstream process or project. This relationship is impossible for teams developing AI products. “Garbage in, garbage out” holds true for AI, so good AI PMs must concern themselves with data health.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are many excellent resources on <a href=\"https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/data-quality\">data quality</a> and <a href=\"http://www.datagovernance.com/defining-data-governance/\">data governance</a>. The specifics are outside the scope of this article, but here are some core principles that should be incorporated into any product manager’s toolkit:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Beware of “data cleaning” approaches that damage your data. It’s not data cleaning if it changes the core properties of the underlying data.&nbsp;</li><li>Look for peculiarities in your data (for example, data from legacy systems that truncate text fields to save space).</li><li>Understand the risks of bad downstream standardization when planning and implementing data collection (e.g. arbitrary stemming, stop word removal.).</li><li>Ensure data stores, key pipelines, and queries are properly documented, with structured metadata and a well-understood data flow.</li><li>Consider how time impacts your data assets, as well as seasonal effects and other biases.</li><li>Understand that data bias and artifacts can be introduced by UX choices and survey design.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Augmenting AI Product Management with Technical Leadership</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There is no intuitive way to predict what will work best in AI product development. AI PMs can build amazing things, but this often comes largely from the right frameworks rather than the correct tactical actions. Many new tech capabilities have the potential to enable software engineering using ML/AI techniques more quickly and accurately. AI PMs will need to leverage new and emerging AI techniques (image upscaling, synthetic text generation using adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, and more), and partner with expert technologists to put these tools to use.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s unlikely that every AI PM will have world-class technical intuition in addition to excellent product sense, UI/X experience, customer knowledge, leadership skills, and so on. But don’t let that breed pessimism. Since one person can’t be an expert at everything, AI PMs need to form a partnership with a technology leader (e.g., a <a href=\"https://ajahne.github.io/blog/leadership/2018/02/16/what-is-a-tech-lead.html#:~:text=A%20Tech%20Lead%20is%20a,to%20achieve%20a%20collective%20goal.&amp;text=A%20Tech%20Lead%20is%20learning,delegating%20work%20effectively%20without%20micromanaging.\">Technical Lead </a>or Lead Scientist) who knows the state of the art and is familiar with current research, and trust that tech leader’s educated intuition.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Finding this critical technical partner can be difficult, especially in today’s competitive talent market.&nbsp; However, all is not lost:&nbsp; there are many excellent technical product leaders out there masquerading as competent engineering managers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Product manager Matt Brandwein suggests observing what potential tech leads do in their idle time, and taking note of which domains they find attractive. Someone’s current role often doesn’t reveal where their interests and talent lie. Most importantly, the AI PM should look for a tech lead who can mitigate their own weaknesses. For example, if the AI PM is a visionary, picking a technical lead with operational experience is a good idea.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Testing ML/AI Products</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When a product is ready to ship, the PM will work with user research and engineering teams to develop a release plan that collects both qualitative and quantitative user feedback. The bulk of this data will be concentrated on user interaction with the user interface and front end of the product. AI PMs must also plan to collect data about the “hidden” functionality of the AI product, the part no user ever sees directly: model performance. We’ve discussed the need for proper instrumentation at both the model and business levels to gauge the product’s effectiveness; this is where all of that planning and hard work pays off!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On the model side, performance metrics that were validated during development (predictive power, model fit, precision) must be constantly re-evaluated as the model is exposed to more and more unseen data. A/B testing, which is frequently used in web-based software development, is useful for evaluating model performance in production. Most companies already have a framework for A/B testing in their release process, but some may need to invest in testing infrastructure. Such investments are well worth it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s inevitable that the model will require adjustments over time, so AI PMs must ensure that whoever is responsible for the product post-launch has access to the development team in order to investigate and resolve issues. Here, A/B testing has another benefit: the ability to run champion/challenger model evaluations. This framework allows for a deployed model to run uninterrupted, while a second model is evaluated against a sample of the total population. If the second model outperforms the original, it can simply be swapped out-often without any downtime!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Overall, AI PMs should remain closely involved in the early release lifecycle for AI products, taking responsibility for coordinating and managing A/B tests and user data collection, and resolving issues with the product’s functionality. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In this article, we’ve focused primarily on the AI product development process, and mapping the AI product manager’s responsibilities to each stage of that process. As with many other digital product development cycles, AI PMs must first ensure that the problem to be solved is both a problem that ML/AI <em>can</em> solve and a problem that is vital to the business. Once this criteria has been met, the AI PM must consider whether the product <em>should</em> be developed, considering the myriad of technical and ethical considerations at play when developing and releasing a production AI system.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We propose the AI Product Development Process as a blueprint for AI PMs of all industries, who may develop myriad different AI products. Though this process is by no means exhaustive, it emphasizes the kind of critical thinking and cross-departmental collaboration necessary to success at each stage of the AI product lifecycle. However, regardless of the process you use, experimentation is the key to success.&nbsp; We’ve said that repeatedly, and we aren’t tired: the more experiments you can do, the more likely you are to build a product that works (i.e., positively impacts metrics the company cares about).&nbsp; And don’t forget qualitative metrics that help you understand user behavior!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Once an AI system is released and in use, however, the AI PM has a somewhat unique role in product maintenance. Unlike PMs for many other software products, AI PMs must ensure that robust testing frameworks are built and utilized not only during the development process, but also in post-production. Our next article focuses on perhaps the most important phase of the AI product lifecycle: maintenance and debugging.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/DDocWJDec48\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/bringing-an-ai-product-to-market/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/bringing-an-ai-product-to-market/'}, {'title': 'Power, Harms, and Data', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Power, Harms, and Data'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/4vYzmXiKdDA/'}], 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/4vYzmXiKdDA/', 'comments': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/power-harms-and-data/#respond', 'published': 'Tue, 28 Jul 2020 12:20:32 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2020, tm_mon=7, tm_mday=28, tm_hour=12, tm_min=20, tm_sec=32, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=210, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Mike Loukides'}], 'author': 'Mike Loukides', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Mike Loukides'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'AI & ML', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Commentary', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/?p=13178', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'A recent article in The Verge discussed PULSE, an algorithm for “upsampling” digital images.

PULSE, when applied to a low-resolution image of Barack Obama, recreated a White man&#8217;s face; applied to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, it built a White woman&#8217;s face.\\xa0 It had similar problems with other images of Black and Hispanic people, frequently giving them White skin and facial features. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>PULSE could be used for applications like upsampling video for 8K ultra high-definition, but I’m less interested in the algorithm and its applications than in the discussion about ethics that it provoked. Is this just a problem with training data, as Yann LeCun said on Twitter?\\xa0 Or is it a sign of larger systemic issues about bias and power, as Timnit Gebru argued? The claim that this is only a problem with the data is tempting, but it is important to step back and see the bigger issues: nothing is “just” a problem with data.\\xa0 That shift to a wider perspective is badly needed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There’s no question that the training data was a problem.\\xa0 If the algorithm were trained using a set of photos dominated by Black people, it would no doubt turn White faces into Black ones. With the right training set and training process, we could presumably minimize errors. When looked at this way, it&#8217;s largely a problem of mathematics and statistics. That’s the position that Timnit Gebru rejects, because it obscures the bigger issues hiding behind the training set. As organizations like <a href=\"http://d4bl.org/\">Data For Black Lives</a>, <a href=\"https://blackinai.github.io/\">Black in AI</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.ajl.org/\">Algorithmic Justice League</a>, and others have been pointing out, it&#8217;s never just an issue of statistics. It&#8217;s an issue of harms and of power. Who stands to gain? Who stands to lose? That&#8217;s the point we really need to consider, particularly when we&#8217;re asking AI to create &#8220;information&#8221; where nothing existed before. Who controls the erasure, or the creation, of color? What are the assumptions that lie behind it?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I do not believe there are many AI researchers giggling about turning Black people into Whites (though there are no doubt some). Nor do I believe there&#8217;s some kind of racist demon lurking in the mathematics implemented by neural networks. But errors like this nevertheless happen; they happen all too frequently; the results are often harmful; and none of us are surprised that the transition was Black-&gt;White rather than the other way around. We were not surprised when we found that products like COMPAS recommended tougher criminal sentences for Black people than for Whites; nor were we surprised when Timnit Gebru and Joy Buolamwini showed that <a href=\"http://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212\">facial recognition is much less accurate</a> for Black people than White people, and particularly inaccurate for Black women.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So, how do we think about the problem of power and race in AI? Timnit Gebru is right; saying that the problem is in the training data ignores the real problem.\\xa0 As does being saddened and making vague promises about doing better in the future.\\xa0 If we aren’t surprised, why?\\xa0 What do we have to learn, and how do we put that learning into practice?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We can start by considering what &#8220;biased training data&#8221; means. One of my favorite collections of essays about data is <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/raw-data-oxymoron\">&#8220;Raw Data&#8221; is an Oxymoron</a>. There is no such thing as &#8220;raw data,&#8221; and hence, no pure, unadulterated, unbiased data. Data is always historical and, as such, is the repository of historical bias. Data doesn’t just grow, like trees; data is collected, and the process of data collection often has its own agenda. Therefore, there are different ways of understanding data, different ways of telling stories about data–some of which account for its origin and relation to history, and some of which don’t.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Take, for example, housing data. That data will show that, in most places in the US, Black people live in separate neighborhoods from White people. But there are a number of stories we can tell about that data.\\xa0 Here are two very different stories:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Segregated housing reflects how people want to live: Black people want to live near other Black people, and so on.</li><li>Segregated housing reflects many years of policy aimed at excluding Black people from White neighborhoods: lending policy, educational policy, real estate policy.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are many variations on those stories, but those two are enough. Neither is entirely wrong—though the first story erases an important fact, that White people have generally had the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining\">power</a> to prevent Black people from moving into their neighborhoods. The second story doesn’t treat that data as an intransigent given; it critiques the data, asks that data how and why it came to be.\\xa0 As I’ve <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/what-we-learn-from-ais-biases/\">argued</a>, AI is capable of revealing our biases, and showing us where they are hidden.\\xa0 It gives us an opportunity to learn about and critique our own institutions.\\xa0 If you don’t look critically at the data, its origins, and its stories (something that’s not a part of most computer science curricula), you’re likely to institutionalize the bias embedded in the data behind a wall of <a href=\"https://www.mathwashing.com/\">mathwashing</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are plenty of situations in which that critique is needed.\\xa0 Here’s one: researchers looking at ride data from Chicago’s public data portal found that the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04599.pdf\">dynamic pricing algorithms</a> used by ride-hailing services (such as Uber and Lyft) charged more for rides to and from low-income, nonwhite areas. This effect might not have been discovered without machine learning.\\xa0 It means that it’s time to audit the services themselves, and find out exactly why their algorithms behave this way. And it’s an opportunity to learn what stories the data is telling us.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The real issue is which of those stories we choose to tell. I use the word &#8220;we&#8221; because the data doesn&#8217;t tell a story on its own, any more than a pixelated image of President Obama becomes a White man on its own. Someone chooses what story to tell; someone releases the software; and that someone is a person, not an algorithm. So if we really want to get to the bottom of the upsampling problem with PULSE, we need to be looking at people in addition to training data. If PULSE needed more images of Black people in its training set, why didn&#8217;t it have them? And why are we not surprised that these issues show up all the time, in applications ranging from <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm\">COMPAS</a> to the Google app that tagged Black people as gorillas?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That&#8217;s really a question about the teams of people who are creating and testing this software. They are predominantly White and male. I admit that if I wrote a program that upsampled images, it might not occur to me to test a Black person’s face. Or to test whether jail sentences for White and Black people are comparable. Or to test whether a real estate application will recommend that Black people consider buying homes in largely White neighborhoods. These not-so-microaggressions are the substance from which greater abuses of power are made. And we’re more likely to discover those microaggressions in time to stop them if the teams developing the software include people with Black and Brown faces, as well as White ones.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The problem isn’t limited to building teams that realize we need different training data, or that understand the need for testing against different kinds of bias.\\xa0 We also need teams that can think about what applications should and shouldn’t be built. Machine learning is complicit in many power structures. Andrew Ng&#8217;s newsletter, The Batch, gives <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/11/deepmind-researchers-propose-rebuilding-the-ai-industry-on-a-base-of-anticolonialism/\">payday lending</a> as an example. An application might compute the optimal interest rate to charge any customer, and that app might easily be &#8220;fair&#8221; by some mathematical standard–although even that is <a href=\"https://medium.com/datakinduk/no-fair-how-can-we-guarantee-fairness-in-ai-e13c92befe42\">problematic</a>. But the industry itself exists to take advantage of vulnerable, low-income people. In this situation, it is impossible for an algorithm—even a &#8220;fair&#8221; one—to be fair. Likewise, given the current power structures, along with the possibility for abuse, it is very difficult to imagine a face recognition application, no matter how accurate, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/07/defund-facial-recognition/613771/\">that isn’t subject to abuse</a>. Fairness isn’t a mathematical construct that can be embodied by an algorithm; it has everything to do with the systems in which the algorithm is embedded. The algorithms used to identify faces can also be used to identify <a href=\"https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/\">bird species</a>, <a href=\"https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/\">detect diseased tomatoes</a> on a farm, and the like. The ethical problem isn’t the algorithm, it’s the context and the power structures, and those are issues that most software teams aren’t used to thinking about.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There’s an even better example close at hand: PULSE itself.\\xa0 Obscuring faces by replacing them with low-resolution, pixelated images is a classic way of protecting the identity of the person in the photograph.\\xa0 It’s something people do to protect themselves–a particularly important issue in these days of incognito armies. Software like PULSE, even (especially) if it is trained correctly, undoes individuals’ efforts to protect their own privacy.\\xa0 It tips the power relationship even further in the direction of the empowered. And an application like Stanford’s <a href=\"http://blm.stanford.edu/\">#BlackLivesMatter PrivacyBot</a> tips the balance back the other way.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are many ways to address these issues of bias, fairness, and power, but they all start with building inclusive teams, and with taking a step back to look at the bigger issues involved. You are more likely to detect bias if there are people on the team who have been victims of bias. You are more likely to think about the abuse of power if the team includes people who have been abused by power. And, as I&#8217;ve argued elsewhere, the job of &#8220;programming&#8221; is becoming less about writing code, and more about understanding the nature of the problem to be solved. In the future, machines will write a lot of code for us. Our task will be deciding what that software should do—not putting our heads down and grinding out lines of code.

IBM&#8217;s announcement went the furthest; they&#8217;re <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21284683/ibm-no-longer-general-purpose-facial-recognition-analysis-software\">withdrawing</a> from face recognition research and product development. Amazon&#8217;s statement was much more limited; they&#8217;re putting a <a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/policy/we-are-implementing-a-one-year-moratorium-on-police-use-of-rekognition\">one-year moratorium</a> on the police use of their Rekognition product, and hoping that Congress will pass regulation on the use of face recognition in the meantime.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These statements are fine, as far as they go. As many point out, Amazon and Microsoft are just passing the buck to Congress, which isn&#8217;t likely to do anything substantial. (As far as I know, Amazon is still partnering with local police forces on their <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/Privacy-advocates-alarmed-by-Amazon-s-Ring-15059699.php\">Ring smart lock</a>, which includes a camera.) And, as others have pointed out, IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon are not the most important companies that supply face recognition technology to law enforcement. That&#8217;s dominated by a number of less prominent companies, of which the most visible are Palantir and Clearview AI. I suspect the executives at those companies are smiling; perhaps IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon aren&#8217;t the most important players, but their departure (even if only temporary) means that there&#8217;s less competition.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So, much as I approve companies pulling back from products that are used unethically, we also have to be clear about what this actually accomplishes: not much. Other companies that are less concerned about ethics will fill the gap.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another response is increased efforts within cities to ban the use of face recognition technologies by police. That trend, of course, isn&#8217;t new; San Francisco, Oakland, Boston, and a number of other cities have instituted such bans. Accuracy is an issue—not just for people of color, but for anyone. London&#8217;s police chief is on record as saying that he&#8217;s &#8220;completely comfortable&#8221; with the use of face recognition technology, despite their department&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/5/17535814/uk-face-recognition-police-london-accuracy-completely-comfortable\">98% false positive rate</a>. I&#8217;ve seen similar statements, and similar false positive rates, from other departments.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We&#8217;ve also seen the first known case of a person <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/24/882678392/man-says-he-was-falsely-arrested-after-facial-recognition-mistake\">falsely arrested because of face recognition</a>. &#8220;First known case&#8221; is extremely important in this context; the victim only found out that he was targeted by face recognition because he overheard a conversation between police officers. We need to ask: how many people have already been arrested, imprisoned, and even convicted on the basis of incorrect face recognition? I am sure that number isn&#8217;t zero, and I suspect it is shockingly large.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>City-wide bans on the use of face recognition by police are a step in the right direction; statewide and national legislation would be better; but I think we have to ask the harder question. Given that police response to the protests over George Floyd&#8217;s murder has revealed that, in many cities, law enforcement is essentially lawless, will these regulations have any effect? Or will they just be ignored? My guess is &#8220;ignored.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That brings me to my point: given that companies backing off from sales of face recognition products, and local regulation of the use of these products, are praiseworthy but unlikely to be effective, what other response is possible? How do we shift the balance of power between surveillors and surveillees? What can be done to subvert these systems?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are two kinds of responses. First, the use of extreme fashion. <a href=\"https://cvdazzle.com/\">CVDazzle</a> is one site that shows how fashion can be used to defeat face detection. There are others, such as <a href=\"https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/07/juggalo-makeup-facial-recognition/\">Juggalo makeup</a>. If you don&#8217;t like these rather extreme looks, remember that researchers have shown that even a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08945\">few altered pixels</a> can defeat image recognition, changing a stop sign into something else. Can a simple &#8220;birthmark,&#8221; applied with a felt-tip pen or lipstick, defeat face recognition? I have not read anything about this specifically, but I would bet that it can. Facemasks themselves provide good protection from face ID, and COVID-19 is not going away any time soon.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The problem with these techniques (particularly my birthmark suggestion) is that you don&#8217;t know what technology is being used for face recognition, and useful adversarial techniques depend highly on the specific face recognition model. The CVDazzle site states clearly that it&#8217;s designs have only been tested against one algorithm (and one that is now relatively old.) Juggalo makeup doesn’t alter basic facial structure. Fake birthmarks would depend on very specific vulnerabilities in the face recognition algorithms. Even with facemasks, there has been research on reconstructing images of faces when you only have an image of the <a href=\"https://www.i-programmer.info/news/105-artificial-intelligence/13756-from-ears-to-faces.html\">ears</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Many vendors (including Adobe and YouTube) have provided tools for <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/05/29/video-editing-tools-photo-apps-blur-faces-protect-identity/5284733002/\">blurring faces</a> in photos and videos.\\xa0Stanford has just released\\xa0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://blm.stanford.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">a new web app</a>\\xa0that detects all the faces in the picture and blocks them out. Anyone who is at a demonstration and wants to take photographs should use these.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But we shouldn&#8217;t limit ourselves to defense. In many cities, police refused to identify themselves; in Washington DC, an <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/05/protests-washington-dc-federal-agents-law-enforcement-302551\">army of federal agents</a> appeared, wearing no identification or insignia. And similar incognito armies have recently appeared in Portland, Oregon and other cities. Face recognition works both ways, and I bet that most of the software you&#8217;d need to construct a face recognition platform is open source. Would it be possible to create a tool for identifying violent police officers and bringing them to justice? Indeed, human rights groups are already using AI: there’s an important initiative to use AI to document <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/25/1004466/ai-could-help-human-rights-activists-prove-war-crimes/\">war crimes in Yemen</a>. If it’s difficult or impossible to limit the use of facial recognition by those in power, the answer may well be to give these tools to the public to increase accountability–much as David Brin suggested many years ago in his prescient book about privacy, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Transparent_Society\"><em>The Transparent Society.</em></a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Technology &#8220;solutionism&#8221; won&#8217;t solve the problem of abuse—whether that&#8217;s abuse of technology itself, or more plain old physical abuse. But we shouldn&#8217;t naively think that regulation will put technology back into some mythical &#8220;box.&#8221; Face recognition isn&#8217;t going away. That being the case, people interested in justice need to understand it, experiment with ways to deflect it, and perhaps even to start using it.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/Iei1x99gJpY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/ai-protests-and-justice/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/ai-protests-and-justice/'}, {'title': 'Four short links: 21 July 2020', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Four short links: 21 July 2020'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/46O69AQ9gNM/'}], 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/46O69AQ9gNM/', 'comments': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/four-short-links-21-july-2020/#respond', 'published': 'Tue, 21 Jul 2020 11:20:35 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2020, tm_mon=7, tm_mday=21, tm_hour=11, tm_min=20, tm_sec=35, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=203, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Nat Torkington'}], 'author': 'Nat Torkington', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Nat Torkington'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Four Short Links', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Signals', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/?p=13153', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': '22 Principles for Great Product Managers &#8212; This list—pieced together over the past few years—reflects what I believe are some of the most important principles for product managers.

Here’s a summary of our key findings:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Most adopters are successful with microservices.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>A minority (under 10%) reports “complete success,” but a clear majority (54%) describes their use as at least “mostly successful” and 92% of the respondents had at least some success.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Microservices practices are surprisingly mature</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> About 28% of respondents say their organizations have been using microservices for at least three years; more than three-fifths (61%) of the respondents have been using microservices for a year or more.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Adopters are betting big on microservices</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> Almost one-third (29%) of respondents say their employers are migrating or implementing a majority of their systems (over 50%) using microservices.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Success with microservices means owning the software lifecycle</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Most (74%) respondents say their teams own the build-test-deploy-maintain phases of the software lifecycle.

Decomposing monolithic applications into microservices is also a major challenge, but complexity may be the biggest challenge of all.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Respondent Demographics</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Technical roles dominate, but management roles are represented, too.&nbsp;</em>Software engineers comprise the survey audience’s single largest cluster, over one quarter (27%) of respondents (Figure 1). If you combine the different architectural roles—i.e., software and systems architects, technical leads—architects represent almost 28% of the sample. Adding architects and engineers, we see that roughly 55% of the respondents are directly involved in software development. Respondents in management roles constitute close to 23% of the audience; executive-level positions (vice presidents and CxOs) account for roughly 13%, overall.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, the audience for this survey—like those of almost all Radar surveys—is disproportionately technical. Technical roles represented in the “Other” category include IT managers, data engineers, DevOps practitioners, data scientists, systems engineers, and systems administrators. Each of these roles comprised less than 3% of all respondents.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_01-1-1048x699.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13104\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_01-1-1048x699.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_01-1-300x200.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_01-1-768x512.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_01-1.png 1088w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption><em>Figure 1: Respondent roles</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Respondents work in more than 25 different vertical industries</em>.The single largest cluster consists of respondents (26%) from the software industry.

The “Other” category, at more than 22% of the total, includes respondents from education (3%, combining K12 and higher education), insurance (3%), energy and utilities (2%), media/entertainment (2%), non-profit (2%), consumer products (1%) and other verticals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Microservices aren’t just for the big guys</em>. Large companies are amply represented, and respondents affiliated with organizations of 1,000 or more employees comprise 42% of the audience. Overall, however, small- and medium-sized organizations predominate. The largest single cluster (33% of all respondents) was organizations with under 100 employees.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>A good global mix</em>. We’re used to seeing a North American-centric tilt in our Radar surveys. This is true, too, of the audience for this survey, nearly half of which (over 49%) works in North America. Europe—inclusive of the United Kingdom—was the next largest region, comprising almost 26% of all respondents. Asia-Pacific accounts for roughly 15% of respondents. In total, just over half of the audience hails from outside of North America. This roughly mirrors usage on the O’Reilly learning platform.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Microservices Adoption: Explication and Analysis</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Slightly more than one-third of respondents say their organizations have been using microservices for between 1 and 3 years (Figure 3). This is the single largest cluster in our sample. The second-largest cluster, at nearly one-quarter (over 23%) of respondent organizations, does not use microservices at all. Mature adopters, companies that first adopted microservices between 3 and 5 years ago, comprise the third-largest cluster, at 18%. If you factor in the respondents whose organizations first adopted microservices over 5 years ago, this means that more than 28% of respondent organizations have been using microservices for at least three years. A little under one-sixth of companies (15%) are just beginning microservice adoption, however; they’ve been using microservices for less than 1 year.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_03-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13105\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_03-1.png 994w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_03-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_03-1-768x433.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 994px) 100vw, 994px\" /><figcaption><em>Figure 3: Duration of use of microservices</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The pace of adoption, in which a clear majority (61%) of respondents say their organizations have used microservices for between 1 and 5 years, roughly tracks with empirical trends we’ve observed internally (e.g., with respect to keyword search and topic usage activity on the O’Reilly online learning platform) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F011spz0k\">in other contexts</a>. The share of adoption for the 12-month period between January of 2019 and January of 2020 likewise suggests that microservices remains a topic of interest to O’Reilly users. On the other hand, there’s evidence from other quarters that interest in microservices—<a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2019-01-31%202020-01-31&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F011spz0k\">both as a topic</a>&nbsp;and as a general&nbsp;<a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2019-01-31%202020-01-31&amp;geo=US&amp;q=Microservices\">search term</a>—has flattened (and perhaps even cooled) over the 12 months.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So not only are most respondents using microservices, but three-fifths (61%) have been using them for a year or more. But do they describe their experience as successful? What share of the systems they’re deploying or maintaining are built to microservices architecture? What characteristics do successful adopters share? What can we learn from those who say they’ve failed with microservices?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Critical Factors for Success</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A majority of respondents (55%) say their organization’s use of microservices has been either a “complete success” (close to 9%) or “mostly successful” (Figure 4).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_04-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13106\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_04-1.png 973w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_04-1-300x189.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_04-1-768x483.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px\" /><figcaption><em>Figure 4: Success with microservices</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>More than one-third (37%) say they’ve had “some success” with microservices. Approximately 8% say they haven’t been successful at all. However, relationships in the data hint at several critical factors for success. For example, in organizations in which development teams own the entire development cycle (i.e., building, testing, deployment, and maintenance), close to half (almost 49%) also reported being “mostly successful” with microservices—and more than 10% said their microservices development efforts were a “complete success. (Figure 5). The combined tally (close to 59%) is about 18% higher than the baseline tally for the survey audience as a whole.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_05-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13107\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_05-1.png 837w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_05-1-300x163.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_05-1-768x417.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 837px) 100vw, 837px\" /><figcaption><em>Figure 5: Do dev teams own/not own the software lifecycle?</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Do we see meaningful connections between success with microservices and the use, or disuse, of specific technologies? Perhaps; we’ll take a look at that next, specifically with respect to containers, centrally managed databases, and monolithic UIs. The semantics get a bit twisted, but the connections we identify seem more strongly associated with “disuse” than with “use.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We emphasize the qualifier “seem” because—with respect to the problem of identifying factors for success—we lack detailed data to draw rigorous conclusions. We kept our survey simple; our priority was to develop a general sense of how, why, and in which scenarios people are using microservices. For the most part, our questions didn’t drill down into specifics. We emphasize “seem” for another reason, too. When we asked respondents to cite the biggest challenges to microservices adoption, two problems—<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)\">decomposition</a>&nbsp;and complexity—stood out for us. Decomposition because it came in at #2, trailing only corporate culture / mindset, which (in almost all Radar surveys) is #1; complexity because two ostensibly different kinds of complexity—“increased complexity” (#4) and the “complexity of managing many services” (#5)—cracked the top 5. Add them together and respondents view complexity in one form or another as the biggest challenge.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The upshot is that complexity in general and (more specifically) the complexity associated with decomposition are the shoals in which most microservices projects seem to run aground. That’s hard to argue with; complexity is rarely (if ever) associated with success. But it’s easy to pretend that complexity is the enemy when it’s really only one variable in a set of tradeoffs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What does that mean? Although it’s not a question we asked, anecdotally we hear that most microservices projects are replacing large, legacy, monolithic software systems. Those monoliths are themselves very complex, having evolved over decades. The complexity of the monolith that’s being replaced is a “sunk cost” that has only partially been paid; it continues to extract a toll as that software is extended to support new features, changing business models, changing modes of user interaction, and more. Microservices may require paying a complexity cost again, but that’s where the tradeoff comes in: in return for the complexity of re-engineering the system, you get increased flexibility, including a simpler path to adding new features, simpler management, simplified scaling as the organization grows.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Use of Containers for Microservice Deployment</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We asked respondents what proportion of their microservices they deploy using containers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The largest single cluster (38%) for this question consists of respondents that do not deploy their microservices in containers. One might reasonably expect that containers would be the most common means of instantiating microservices. This just isn’t the case, however. Our findings indicate that, for our survey audience as a whole, most respondents (58%) deploy microservices using some medium other than containers (Figure 6).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_06-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13108\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_06-1.png 903w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_06-1-300x176.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_06-1-768x451.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px\" /><figcaption><em>Figure 6: Proportion of microservices deployed using containers</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are valid reasons not to use containers. For some adopters, technical debt (in the form of custom-built, proprietary and monolithic systems, applications, or architectures) is a constraining factor. So it just makes sense to instantiate microservices at the level of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_virtualization\">virtual machine</a>&nbsp;(VM), as distinct to that of the container. Or maybe it’s faster and less costly, at least in the short term, to build and instantiate microservices as non-virtualized code running in the context of a conventional operating system, a database, application server, etc..</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This doesn’t mean respondents aren’t using containers; most of the survey audience is. It’s just that containers are not yet the most popular means of instantiating microservices, although that could be changing. For example, the second-largest cluster (31%) for this question consists of organizations that deploy between 75% and 100% of their microservices using containers. And 11% use containers to deploy between 50 and 75% of their microservices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The upshot is that more than two-fifths (42%) of respondent organizations use containers to deploy at least half of their microservices—and that, for the survey audience as a whole, nearly two-thirds (62%) are using containers to deploy at least&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;of their microservices. So we have a split: on the one hand, most microservices are instantiated using a technique other than containers; on the other hand, most organizations that use microservices also instantiate at least some of them in containersFor example, 10% of respondents say they use containers to deploy between 10-25% of their microservices; a little more than 9% deploy between 25-50% of microservices with containers; and, again, 11% deploy between 50-75% using containers.<sup>1</sup> It seems adopters either go (mostly) all-in on containers, using them for most microservices, or use them sparingly.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There’s a critical, and intriguing, “but” here: a higher than average proportion of respondents who report success with microservices opt to instantiate them using containers; conversely, a much higher proportion of respondents who describe their microservices efforts as “Not successful at all”&nbsp;<em>do not</em>&nbsp;instantiate them in containers. For example, almost half (49%) of respondents who describe their deployments as “a complete success” also instantiate most of their microservices (75-100%) in containers. This is more than 5x the baseline (9%) for this question. Conversely, an overwhelming majority (83%) of respondents who describe their microservices efforts as “Not successful at all” are instantiating them by some means other than containers. (These are respondents who use containers in conjunction with less than 10% of their microservices.) This is about 11x the baseline for this question (Figure 4).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This observation makes intuitive sense. With microservices, instead of deploying one monolithic application, you may need to deploy and manage hundreds or thousands of services. Using containers to standardize deployment, and container orchestration tools to automate ongoing management, greatly simplifies the burden of deployment and management. It’s worth remembering that “containers” get their name by analogy to shipping containers: instead of loading a ship with 10,000 cases of canned soup, 20,000 board-feet of lumber, and a few thousand automobile tires, the shippers would pack their goods in standardized containers that could be stacked up on the ship. This represents a significant reduction in the cost of shipping–or the operational cost of deploying and maintaining software. Containers are a simplifying technology.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Use of a Central, Managed Database</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When we asked respondents what proportion of their microservices share a central, managed database (Figure 7), we found that not using a centrally managed database with microservices tends to be associated with failure. That said, the question itself (i.e., “What percentage of your microservices share a centrally-managed database?”) doesn’t give us much to go on. We don’t know what respondents considered a centrally managed database; what kind of database they were using (relational or non-relational); or whether transactional integrity was an issue.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_07-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13109\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_07-1.png 901w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_07-1-300x180.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_07-1-768x462.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px\" /><figcaption><em>Figure 7: Proportion of microservices that use a centrally managed database</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Granted that there’s a lot we’d like to know that we don’t, let’s think about why this question is important, and dig a bit deeper. The point of microservices is breaking an application into separate, decoupled services. Using the database as the integration point between services is counter to this purpose. The result is a software system that looks like it’s built from microservices, but really isn’t, and which realizes few of the promised advantages because the individual services are still coupled to each other at the database layer.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Are our respondents succeeding with decoupled databases? For our survey audience, it looks like the smaller the proportion of microservices that share access to a central, managed database, the greater the likelihood of failure. Think of this as what&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias\">survivorship bias</a>&nbsp;is most apt to miss: i.e., failure. The lesson in such cases is usually that failure&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@penguinpress/an-excerpt-from-how-not-to-be-wrong-by-jordan-ellenberg-664e708cfc3d\">tells a valuable story of its own</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of the respondents who said that they are “not successful at all,” 71% said that they did not make much use of a centrally managed database (under 10% of their microservices). The problem is that we don’t actually know what using (or not using) a centrally managed database entails because the question itself is imprecise. For example, a recommended practice is to implement a separate namespace for each microservice. This can be accomplished in several ways—including by using a centralized database!<sup>2</sup> But implementing a separate namespace for each service raises a number of hard problems, starting with transactional integrity and data consistency, and (notionally) encompassing security and privacy, too. Working through these issues isn’t easy, even with a centralized database. It’s much harder without one, however.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, while it’s easy to look at these failures and suppose that using a separate database (or database schema) per service is a bad idea that leads to failure, that’s far from the whole picture. Think back to where we started this section: microservices represents a tradeoff of complexity against flexibility. (And also a tradeoff of complexity now versus complexity accreted over the years in a legacy system–we could perhaps think of paying off technical debt with a big “balloon payment.”) Replacing a legacy monolith with microservices isn’t easy. But working through the current complexity to build a system that’s more likely to serve your future needs is what good engineering is all about. And when you’re building a complex system, you need to know where the pain points are. That’s what this data is really telling us: redesigning databases to eliminate dependencies between services is a significant pain point.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Monolithic UI</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We also asked users what percentage of the systems deployed as microservices had a monolithic user interface (Figure 8). This question is also problematic. First, what is a monolithic UI? More to the point, what would our respondents assume we mean by a monolithic UI, and what are they doing if they’re not building a monolithic UI? There are several possibilities, none of which is entirely convincing. One recent trend in web development is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html\">“micro frontends”</a>, but this doesn’t appear to be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=micro%20frontend,microservice\">well-known enough</a>&nbsp;to have a significant effect on our data. Respondents are likely to associate a “monolithic UI” with traditional web development (or perhaps even desktop applications or ancient “green screens”), as opposed to the use of components within a framework like React. (Since micro frontends are built with frameworks like React, these may be two names for almost the same thing. Once you’re using a component-based framework, associating components with individual back-end services isn’t a big leap.) In any case, it is likely that a monolithic UI represents a tradeoff for simplicity over flexibility and complexity. A front end built with a modern reactive web framework is almost certainly more flexible–and more complex–than a 1990s-era web form.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Use of a monolithic UI is another possible example of survivorship bias; it’s also another case in which respondents who are successful with microservices are much less interesting than those who aren’t.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_08-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13110\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_08-1.png 904w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_08-1-300x177.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_08-1-768x454.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px\" /><figcaption><em>Figure 8: Proportion of microservices that use a monolithic UI</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Take the cluster of respondents who&nbsp;<em>don’t</em>&nbsp;build a monolithic UI. (That is, &lt;10% of their microservices use a monolithic UI.) At 31% of all respondents, this is the largest group. But it also has the highest rate of complete failure: 17% describe their implementations as “Not successful at all.” Respondents in this group were also more likely to describe their projects as a “complete success” (12%); 37% said they were “mostly successful.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>At the other end of this spectrum, among respondents who used a monolithic UI for 50-75% of their systems, only 2% said they were not successful at all. 8% said their projects were a “complete success,” while 52% said their projects were “mostly successful.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are we to make of this? It’s hard to say, given that the notion of a monolithic UI (and its opposite) are poorly defined. But this looks similar to what we observed for databases. Reactive web frameworks (like React and Angular), which are used to build many modern web interfaces, are very complex systems in their own right. It’s not surprising that systems that don’t use a monolithic UI have a high failure rate, and that systems that implement a monolithic UI have a fairly high success rate; if simplicity for developers were the only criteria, we’d all go back to green screens.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rather than just looking at a “complexity tax,” we have to consider what the goal is: building systems that can easily be extended and scaled as conditions change. Is a UI that isn’t monolithic (regardless of the technology) more complex? Probably so. Ideally, moving a monolithic application’s back end to microservices while maintaining the legacy front-end would be minimal work (though “minimal” is always more minimal in theory than in practice). What’s gained in return? Additional flexibility; in this case, we’d be looking for the ability to support different kinds of user interfaces and different kind of interactions. Adding a mobile or voice UI to a legacy front end can easily become a nightmare; but it’s hard to imagine any modern application that doesn’t have a mobile front-end, and in a few years, it will be hard to imagine an application without a voice-driven front end. Re-envisioning the front end in terms of services (however they may be implemented) is building flexibility into the system. What other user interfaces will we need in the next few years? Again, the issue is never simply “complexity”; it’s what you get in return.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Benefits and Challenges</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Respondents were asked which benefits, if any, they attribute to their successful use of microservices (Figure 9). They were asked to select all applicable benefits.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The largest cluster for this response (at 45%) named “feature flexibility,” followed (at just under 45%) by “responding quickly to changing technology and business requirements.” Just under 44% cited the benefit of “better overall scalability,” followed (43%) by “more frequent code refreshes.” The least-cited benefit (15%) was that of lower development costs; just 20% of respondents say they realized one of the core promises of microservices: improved availability by virtue of multiple, redundant functions (i.e., services).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_09-1-1048x730.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13111\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_09-1-1048x730.png 1048w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_09-1-300x209.png 300w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_09-1-768x535.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_09-1.png 1223w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px\" /><figcaption><em>Figure 9: Benefits of using microservices</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Almost all of our Radar surveys have found that respondents cite corporate culture as one of the top two or three impediments to adoption or success. This survey was no exception. Culture was the most oft-cited challenge: almost 40% of respondents cited culture—or, alternatively, the problem of “overcoming existing mindset”—as among the biggest challenges they faced in adopting microservices (Figure 10). This was the largest cluster for this response, followed (37%) by the challenge of decomposing requirements into primitive/granular functions. The challenge of integrating with legacy systems was third, cited by approximately 30% of respondents.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If we combine the two responses that have to do with complexity (“Increased complexity” and “Complexity of managing many services”), we find that complexity in one form or another is the biggest overall challenge, cited by 56% of respondents.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_10-1-768x1048.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13112\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_10-1-768x1048.png 768w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_10-1-220x300.png 220w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_10-1-1126x1536.png 1126w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/ma20_10-1.png 1253w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption><em>Figure 10: Challenges encountered in adoption of microservices</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Other results of note: at No. 6, technical debt (cited by 28% of respondents) just missed the top five. It’s the kind of hard problem that cannot be wished, willed, or architected away–indeed, replacing a monolithic system with microservices can be seen as a “lump sum” payment of years of accrued technical debt. The rest of the top 10 reads like a laundry list of hard problems: API quality (28%), talent and skill shortages (28%), training and retraining challenges (also 28%) and monitoring/observability (27%) round out the top 10. The high showing for API quality—i.e., their richness, robustness, transparency, accessibility, stability (over time) and usefulness—shouldn’t be surprising. The relatively low result for security (No. 11, cited by 21% of respondents) is surprising.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Takeaways</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For the most part, adopters say they’re having success with microservices: more than half (55%) describe their efforts as at least “mostly” successful. Respondents commonly attribute several clear benefits to their use of microservices, including feature flexibility; the ability to respond to changing business requirements; improved scalability; and more frequent code releases. And, at least among adopters, microservices comprise a growing share of production systems: almost half (46%) of respondents say their organizations are currently developing for or migrating one-quarter or more of their production systems to microservices. Nearly one-sixth (15%) say they’re developing or migrating between 75-100% of their systems to a microservices-oriented architecture. For our audience, microservices architecture is not only established but (for a majority of adopters) used to support systems or workloads in production.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There’s evidence here for the microservices skeptic, too. About 8% of would-be adopters describe their experiences with microservices as “not successful at all.” Proponents will claim that 8% is a shockingly low rate of failure for any software development project, particularly given the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/study-68-percent-of-it-projects-fail/\">historical failure rates of large IT projects</a>; but skeptics will counter that 8% is still, well, 8%. And even if a majority of respondents say they’ve been “mostly successful” with microservices, a sizable percentage (37%) say they’ve had only “some” success. The upshot is that a little under half (45%) of all users have had bad, middling, or only modestly successful experiences with microservices. A skeptic might also point to selection bias: not only is our audience dominated by people in technical roles, but software developers and architects are overrepresented. A survey like this is bound to attract a disproportionate share of participants with an interest in seeing microservices succeed—or fail. In the same way, the person who volunteers her time to complete our survey is more likely than not to be working with or to have an interest in (for or against) microservices. These are all valid objections.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our results emphasize the importance of&nbsp;<em>pragmatic</em>&nbsp;microservices development. Microservices can be complex–there’s no point in denying that. And complexity frequently leads to failure–there’s no point in denying that, either. Using containers for deployment is a way of minimizing complexity. We’ve seen that decoupling databases is frequently a pain point, along with redesigning the user interface as a set of components. But again, it’s important to recognize that microservices rarely arise out of nowhere. Many microservice projects are replacing existing systems. And that existing system has its own complexity: complexity that grew over the years, complexity that’s preventing you from achieving your current goals. If you&#8217;ve become accustomed to your legacy systems, you probably don&#8217;t realize how complex they are–but if you’ve made the decision to migrate from a monolith to microservices, the complexity of maintaining your monolith is almost certainly the reason.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Replacing one kind of complexity with another–is that a gain? Absolutely, if it’s done correctly and enables you to achieve your goals. Complexity is an engineering problem, and engineering problems are always about tradeoffs. When you’re building microservices, keep your eye on the goal–whether that’s supporting new features, scaling for more customers, providing a new experience for users, or something else. Don&#8217;t be surprised that microservices bring their own complexity, and don&#8217;t let that daunt you. But don&#8217;t underestimate the challenge, either.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Special thanks to Kristen Haring, Phil Harvey, Mark Madsen, Roger Magoulas, Larry “Catfish” Murdock, Sam Newman, and Mac Slocum for—among other invaluable contributions—questions, comments, context, and, above all, constructive criticism.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Footnotes</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><sup>1</sup> For example, 10% of respondents say they use containers to deploy between 10-25% of their microservices; a little more than 9% deploy between 25-50% of microservices with containers; and, again, 11% deploy between 50-75% using containers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><sup>2</sup> A development team could use a centrally managed database to create separate namespaces for each service. This practice is notionally consistent with the idea that each microservice should own its data. It also saves developers the headache of coding logic to manage data consistency, transactional durability, and other issues. Or, alternatively, software developers could opt to manage data persistence (along with data consistency and transactional durability) on a per-microservices basis, a practice that is strictly consistent with the idea of data sovereignty, but which radically ups the complexity factor.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/DDKyM3r0Vy4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/microservices-adoption-in-2020/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/microservices-adoption-in-2020/'}, {'title': 'Four short links: 15 July 2020', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Four short links: 15 July 2020'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/0LC0-Gqcfao/'}], 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/0LC0-Gqcfao/', 'comments': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/four-short-links-15-july-2020/#respond', 'published': 'Wed, 15 Jul 2020 11:19:45 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2020, tm_mon=7, tm_mday=15, tm_hour=11, tm_min=19, tm_sec=45, tm_wday=2, tm_yday=197, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Nat Torkington'}], 'author': 'Nat Torkington', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Nat Torkington'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Four Short Links', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Signals', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/?p=13140', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'Fixing Bugs Properly &#8212; Why did a fix that seems so simple when looking at the changes made take two days to complete?

For too long we have been complicit, maintaining the status quo. This must change. I’m writing this as we’re living through three pandemics. Covid-19, structurally enabled racism, and the climate crisis. Each of these pandemics make visible the ways that individuals fit into and contribute to wider communities. Or fail to fit in.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Before Covid-19, it’s likely that <em>society</em> made you think of liberal politics or charity or posh events that you rarely get invited to. Now, I bet you think of society as community. We’ve all become more aware of how connected we are to one another, and our responsibilities to our communities. That’s not only for us as people, but for business too. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Until now innovation frameworks like human-centered design, jobs to be done or design thinking have focused on two things. The first is serving the individual in order to make products and services that people want. This is often called “user needs.” The second is following a “growth imperative,” and a financial measure of success. We’ve asked how software and hardware could help drive profit and GDP.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The result is products and services that give us superpowers. You have a pocket supercomputer that can conveniently beckon a taxi instantly to you. You know exactly where you are. You can instantly communicate and transact from anywhere. However these superpowers come at a cost: your attention is a scarce commodity and your data is put to use in an ocean of advertising.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What strikes me the most is that these innovation frameworks only work when organizations and their teams operate from a place of privilege. It’s easier to ignore the unintended consequences (the “negative externalities” in the industry’s dry jargon) when you are personally not impacted. So it’s unsurprising that institutions like Harvard or Stanford gave birth to these methodologies, Silicon Valley companies popularized them, and consultancies packaged them into toolkits. These are organizations that are often predominantly white, male, and affluent.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Here’s an example. A new generation of electric bike and scooter rideshare startups made it possible to pick up or leave a scooter anywhere in a city. They removed the charging docks, so the user no longer had to find one that had a scooter available to be used, or had a spare slot to return the scooter to. The user would just tell the app that they’d finished with it, and the app took care of the rest, which was very convenient. But this made the experience of moving around the city harder for everyone else, and particularly affected those with limited mobility. So much focus went into serving the needs of the individual that the needs of other people went ignored.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It doesn’t stop at products and services. Individualism has shaped much of our social contract in the West. Data protection frameworks like Europe’s GDPR give us <em>individual</em> rights to data that represents us. Consent is asked for on an individual basis, with cookie banners being the ultimate divide-and-conquer attack on humanity. If consent was gained through hurried and weary clicks on nagging pop-up barriers on countless websites, can it be considered freely given?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A problem with design for the individual is the assumption that data necessarily represents one person. But it doesn’t. In nearly all cases, data represents many people. For example your DNA represents your parents, siblings, and children. Your location data represents where you’ve been with other people, where you see your friends or the walk to school with your kids. Data is inherently social and represents society.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Society-Centered Design</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is where <a href=\"https://societycentered.design/\">Society-centered design</a> comes in. At IF, a technology studio that I run, we believe it’s time to do better. It’s time to make <a href=\"https://www.projectsbyif.com/blog/anti-racist-by-design-for-sharing-economy-platforms/\">better design approaches</a> and <a href=\"https://catalogue.projectsbyif.com/\">tools</a>, <a href=\"https://www.projectsbyif.com/blog/how-to-measure-representation-in-a-data-set-and-protect-peoples-privacy/\">better measures of success</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.projectsbyif.com/blog/using-data-for-public-good/\">better data protection standards</a>. We need a new framework for products, services, and data that is purpose-built for the 21st century. We want to move beyond human-centered design to society-centered design. Where society, not an individual, is at the center.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Society-centered design is about changing the climate of ideas, and moving towards real-world solutions. It’s an approach to problem solving, that develops solutions by putting society in every step of the problem-solving process.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>How could we make rideshare scooters work for wider society as well as the riders? This question is timely because the UK Government is accelerating a plan to allow rentable electric scooters in towns and cities to provide socially-distanced alternatives to public transport.&nbsp; Perhaps the scooters could be dockable so the streets could be less cluttered: the scooter companies would work with local authorities to provide many more docks. The docks could be sufficiently standardized that <em>any</em> scooter or bike could use them for secure storage and charging. Working with open standards, working with the city, working with people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A different and speculative example is how we might rethink data management. <a href=\"https://www.projectsbyif.com/blog/a-bold-new-future-for-permissions/\">I’ve written before</a> about how hard it is to stay on top of all the consent choices you’ve made. If your data preferences change, are you going to visit a million websites to modify the communication and cookie preferences you clicked half a decade ago? What if instead you were able to delegate decision making to an entity that represents your values? That way the consent management is dealt with by a third party. This isn’t a new idea. Tom Steinberg has written about organizations, “<a href=\"https://medium.com/@TomSteinberg/personal-data-representatives-an-idea-d2274d1af69b\">personal data representatives</a>,” that could take on this role. I explored the idea of data cooperatives in 2014. Now there are a growing number of ‘data trust’ experiments from the Open Data Institute, Uber drivers, Sidewalk Labs, and others.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Designing for society means designing for the broader context of systems that we impact and shape. To do this, we must be intentional about citizen empowerment, civic commons, public health, equity, and the planet:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Citizen empowerment: how might we give people more rights and capabilities?</li><li>Civic commons: how might we create shared resources that strengthen communities?</li><li>Public health: how might we protect the safety and improve the physical and mental health of communities?</li><li>Equity: how might we design products, services, and standards that are fair to everyone, not just the most privileged?</li><li>The planet: how might we better care for our world?</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We have a collective opportunity right now to design out the structural inequalities around us. To collectively hold each other accountable, to examine our existing products and services to make sure they are equitable. It’s not enough to play lip service about change within your business. It’s not enough to just look at recruitment practices. It’s not enough to make tweaks to the images you show. To take a society-centered approach means fundamentally looking at the underlying values of your business.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Until now, individual needs have been the foundation of a business’ growth, profit, and culture. Now it’s time to look towards society’s needs. </p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/usb3BbTp1_I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/society-centered-design/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/society-centered-design/'}, {'title': 'Four short links: 14 July 2020', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Four short links: 14 July 2020'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/6dGhNi4-c4A/'}], 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/6dGhNi4-c4A/', 'comments': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/four-short-links-14-july-2020/#respond', 'published': 'Tue, 14 Jul 2020 11:20:12 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2020, tm_mon=7, tm_mday=14, tm_hour=11, tm_min=20, tm_sec=12, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=196, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Nat Torkington'}], 'author': 'Nat Torkington', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Nat Torkington'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Four Short Links', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Signals', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/?p=13129', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'Neutralizing Misinformation through Inoculation &#8212; We found that false-balance media coverage (giving contrarian views equal voice with climate scientists) lowered perceived consensus overall[..].

(Skip to 29:00 of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNhYTLWQFeg\">the video</a>.)&nbsp; Along similar lines, an unrelated research paper reports on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03511\">unsupervised translation</a> of programs from one language to another–indeed, probably an easier task than natural language translation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Microsoft’s demo is, well, a demo, and the research paper is a research paper. Microsoft’s AI was able to provide method bodies for some relatively simple functions; it was obviously rather limited. It begs the question of exactly how you write the comment that tells the AI what to do; are we just replacing a description in a precise programming language with a description in an ambiguous, imprecise human language? I&#8217;m sure that training the model costs more than hiring a developer to write a few short functions. And while it’s easy for me to believe that software can translate some simple code from COBOL to Rust, I can only imagine that it would be horribly confused by the multitude of tricks programmers used in the 1960s and 1970s to deal with computers that had, by modern standards, miniscule memories. Programming jobs are not going to disappear tomorrow.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Nevertheless, it&#8217;s important for us to think about what automation might mean for the future of programming.&nbsp; Is this a glimpse of the future, and if so, what is it telling us? What can we learn from it? Programming will increasingly be automated; and, as someone who got started writing assembler on a PDP-8, I can tell you that programming is already highly automated, and that a good optimizing compiler is already an advanced AI system that takes your hints and turns them into working code.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Programming is not going to &#8220;go away&#8221; or &#8220;become obsolete.&#8221; However, its meaning will change. I&#8217;ve previously written about blue- and white-collar programmers: <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/rethinking-programming/\">programmers who connect things, and programmers who design the things that are connected</a>, and build the tools to connect them. These are different (though highly overlapping) skillsets. And while Microsoft&#8217;s demo may show that programmers may eventually be liberated from the task of coding up simple functions, the code-generating engine was certainly built by a team of programmers, and possibly a large one. The programmers who write the higher-level tools, like Microsoft’s coding engine itself, can breathe a sigh of relief.&nbsp; As can programmers who design APIs, since you still have to provide the function/method signatures.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And the blue-collar programmers who connect things? While this demo could spit out functions, I saw few signs that it could build larger systems out of the functions that it wrote. Although it had the ability to call functions that it had written, it could not put together a large program from a written specification. It might be able to spit out a simple bill, but it certainly couldn&#8217;t spit out a complete billing system. A project for future research? No doubt, but that&#8217;s probably dozens of years out. Programmers who connect things—the plumbers of the digital world—are also safe.<br></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But this feat still begs the question about what we mean by programming. In the video, Kevin Scott talks about reducing the time programmers spend on dull, repetitive tasks. Yes, that&#8217;s what we all say about AI: it will reduce the time spent on dull, repetitive tasks and free more time for creative work. Let&#8217;s break that down, though. Most of programming is specifying, in excruciating detail, how to execute some process. That can be dull, it is often repetitive, and it is certainly error-prone. And we really need to think more about what programming <em>ought</em> to be. To use Scott&#8217;s word, what are the &#8220;creative&#8221; aspects of programming?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure that &#8220;creative&#8221; is the right word. Back in the 1960s and 1970s, more programmers were called &#8220;analysts.&#8221;&nbsp; That job title is still in use, but it’s not all that common: <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm\">Glassdoor</a> shows about 10,000 jobs for “programmer analyst,” 44,000 for “programmer,” and 100,000 for “software engineer.” <a href=\"https://www.monster.com/\">Monster</a> shows about 20,000 for “programmer analyst,” 300,000 for “programmer,” and 170,000 for “software engineer.” </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While the job may have differed little from what it is now, let&#8217;s think about what &#8220;analyst&#8221; means. Analysts analyze a problem; they think about what the problem is, and how to solve it effectively. They think about breaking it up into parts. They may even think about whether it should be solved; they might think about how it should be solved, what ethical issues it raises and how those issues should be handled. Can the software be abused? If so, how? What steps can be taken to prevent abuse? And analysts need to think about how people will use the software: what&#8217;s the user interface, what&#8217;s the user experience, can it be used by people with disabilities?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In O’Reilly’s <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/software-architecture-superstream-series-software-architecture-fundamentals/0636920444961/\">Software Architecture Fundamentals Superstream,</a> Thoughtworks’ Rebecca Parsons said that “analysts” were essentially doing software architecture: making big picture decisions about what the software should do, and how it should be built. Analysts and architects need to understand the business case. They need to present decisions about software systems to management in business terms.&nbsp; She used the need to test a backup strategy as an example: rather than telling the CEO about the technical details, just say “This test will show us how long it will take to get back online if the system crashes on the busiest retail day of the year.” That’s what an analyst does. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our emphasis on writing code, and on measuring productivity by “lines of code,” is myopic. Just look at all the wonderful (and absolutely necessary) tools we have for building, testing, archiving, and deploying code.&nbsp; But those tools, essential and revolutionary as they are, don’t address the real issue: are we solving the right problems? There are thousands of applications out there that pass every unit test, every integration test, and every acceptance test, but are still awful to use.&nbsp; And we are learning that there are new dimensions to software that we’ve rarely thought about: are there groups who need to use our software and can’t? Does your software support accessibility?&nbsp; Can it be used by people who don’t have reliable access to computers and to networks?&nbsp; The work of an organization like <a href=\"https://www.codeforamerica.org/\">Code for America</a> isn’t technically profound or deep.&nbsp; What’s radical about a product like <a href=\"https://www.getcalfresh.org/\">GetCalFresh</a> was the act of re-engineering the system to make it usable by the people who need to use it. And we need a lot more analysis like that.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot more to programming than just slinging code and writing functions. The most important parts of the job have nothing to do with writing quicksort on the whiteboard in an interview. There&#8217;s a lot to think about; and currently, programmers spend too much time rushing code out the door to meet a release date than they spend thinking about the bigger picture. That&#8217;s almost always someone else&#8217;s job. But whether or not it gets into production, Microsoft&#8217;s research gives us an opportunity to think about what programming really means. What&#8217;s the real job? What are we really trying to accomplish?<br></p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/773ZBvCjOn0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/automated-coding-and-the-future-of-programming/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/automated-coding-and-the-future-of-programming/'}, {'title': 'Four short links: 9 July 2020', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Four short links: 9 July 2020'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/w2QbYEGl3Gs/'}], 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/w2QbYEGl3Gs/', 'comments': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/four-short-links-9-july-2020/#respond', 'published': 'Thu, 09 Jul 2020 11:22:40 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2020, tm_mon=7, tm_mday=9, tm_hour=11, tm_min=22, tm_sec=40, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=191, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Nat Torkington'}], 'author': 'Nat Torkington', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Nat Torkington'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Four Short Links', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Signals', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/?p=13115', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'Avoiding Fallback in Distributed Systems &#8212; In this article, the focus will be on how fallback strategies can cause more problems than they fix.

Specifically: why have Japan and Hong Kong not experienced an explosion in cases, even though their governments responded poorly to the crisis? The argument is that some systems are intrinsically difficult to model.&nbsp; There are too many causes and too many effects that interact with each other in ways that are difficult to predict or even understand.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What does that mean? &#8220;Complex systems&#8221; has always implied, at least to me, systems of nonlinear differential equations, chaotic processes, and the like. Think about the motions of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum\">double pendulum</a>. I wouldn&#8217;t deny that there&#8217;s a complex set of mathematical relationships behind the pandemic&#8217;s spread. But the point of the discussion is that we don&#8217;t know those relationships, and discovering them is a slow and difficult process.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As attractive as it may be to think about complex systems, I&#8217;m not convinced that&#8217;s the best approach. I&#8217;ve always been attracted to explanations that are based on a combination of small effects, which themselves are (to a first approximation) randomly distributed. That seems like a much more useful and fruitful way to think about the results we’re seeing in different countries.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What if we thought like this: There are a large number of factors that may or may not have an effect. For the pandemic, that list of factors may look like this:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Wearing masks</li><li>Social isolation</li><li>HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning)</li><li>Social cohesion; importance of the social group relative to the individual</li><li>Effective healthcare system</li><li>Temperature</li><li>Exposure to sunlight</li><li>The language you speak (<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3azbmk/does-speaking-japanese-lower-the-risk-of-spreading-coronavirus\">Japanese evidently requires less exhaling</a>)</li><li>Air pollution</li><li>Obesity</li><li>Diabetes</li><li>Heart disease</li><li>Quality of reporting</li><li>Quality of testing</li><li>Genetic factors</li><li>Virulence of different virus strains</li><li>Housing density</li><li>Congestion in public transportation systems</li><li>Citizens&#8217; ability to self-organize</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>You get the idea; this list could easily go on, possibly including hundreds of factors influencing disease propagation, individual susceptibility, and mortality. Some are important; some are no doubt fake science; some are just weird; and some may be no more than educated guesses. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We can think of these factors as randomly distributed, although they may not be in reality. In some locales they will add up to minimize spread, and in others, the reverse will happen. You can&#8217;t control for, or even measure, several of these factors. But, since we&#8217;re thinking of them as random, the fact that Hong Kong has had a relatively minor outbreak that appears to have been controlled quickly means that several factors that limit spread were present, and added up.&nbsp; The next step is figuring out what the factors appear to be common in best- and worst-case situations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So, if we look at Japan, we see a society where it&#8217;s normal for sick people to wear masks; it’s common decency.&nbsp; Wearing masks as a prophylactic measure isn&#8217;t the big cultural leap that it has been in the United States. We also see a society where obesity is relatively rare, particularly compared to the US (the <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/obesity\">most obese nation in the world</a>). And Japan is a country in which healthcare is free to all citizens—again unlike the US, where a serious disease can easily lead to bankruptcy, particularly with unemployment (and the numbers of uninsured) skyrocketing. The point isn&#8217;t that masks, hospitals, or anything else is some sort of a &#8220;silver bullet&#8221; that makes the problem go away, though in the US we&#8217;ve no doubt undervalued all of these things. Nor can you fix obesity or diabetes or air conditioning as quickly as you can hand out masks. But if each of these factors makes a small contribution—and if, some places, all of those small contributions line up—they have a large effect. Together, they can easily be much more important than a government&#8217;s response. And we might start to suspect that some of these “small” factors, such as <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/masks-help-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-the-science-is-simple-and-im-one-of-100-experts-urging-governors-to-require-public-mask-wearing-138507?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=bylinetwitterbutton\">wearing masks</a>, aren’t so small after all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Hong Kong is a particularly fascinating case. As Zeynep Tufekci argues in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/05/how-hong-kong-beating-coronavirus/611524/\">The Atlantic</a>, Hong Kong&#8217;s citizens were able to self-organize a response, despite their government. That ability no doubt stems from the unrest and demonstrations of the past year. And self-organization no doubt stems from a sense of social cohesion and responsibility that the US has largely abandoned, if it ever had it. (In some future pandemic, might we see that effect protecting communities that are currently protesting police brutality in the US?\\xa0 It&#8217;s worth noting that, at least in protests I&#8217;ve seen, an astonishing number of people were wearing facemasks. And that there hasn&#8217;t been a surge in COVID-19 cases that can be attributed to the protests.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What&#8217;s most interesting is that the ability to self-organize probably wouldn&#8217;t have been on many lists prior to Tufekci&#8217;s article. In college, a professor I worked with told me about his frustration with a defense project he was working on. He was asked to evaluate the probability of an attack on a nuclear facility. His reaction was &#8220;we can evaluate all the scenarios on your list, and the probability will be a very small number. But all that tells me is that, if you&#8217;ve left a scenario off your list, it&#8217;s likely to swamp everything that&#8217;s on it.&nbsp; It’s easy to beat a probability of .00001.&#8221; Black swans 40 years ago. Except in Hong Kong’s case, they&#8217;re not black; they&#8217;re golden.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Which brings us back to the point: understanding the COVID-19 pandemic is less about complex systems than about understanding randomly distributed factors, including some that may surprise us. When we see a group of factors that lead to a good result, we know what to do: hand out masks, provide healthcare, promote the idea that people are responsible for each other, enable spontaneous action, and (to mitigate the next pandemic) wean a society off of its dependence on sugar.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>At this point, we’ve made observations and learned how to act effectively. It is increasingly clear that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/11/875311079/how-the-widespread-mask-use-could-slow-the-coronavirus-pandemic\">wearing masks is a key to shutting down a pandemic</a>; and that self-organization can play a decisive role to <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2020/06/16/texas-mayors-greg-abbott-face-masks/\">governmental opposition to enforcing mask-wearing</a>. That isn&#8217;t to say that we shouldn&#8217;t understand the other points: the influence of HVAC, the virulence of different pathogens, the response of different immune systems, and so on. Nor is it to say that we shouldn’t try to understand the system in all its complexity.&nbsp; That may be necessary to develop effective treatment. But you don’t need to understand the complex system to develop an effective response to a crisis.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Now take a step back and think about applying these ideas to other issues.&nbsp; What about the re-emergence of racism and neo-nazisim in the US?&nbsp; Just to be clear—they were never gone.&nbsp; But, just as with COVID-19, we need to understand the forces that will suppress outbreaks.&nbsp; Racism has been manipulated for hundreds of years, and is deeply embedded in many of our institutions.&nbsp; As with any disease, what are the forces that drive it, and what are the actions that disable it? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What about economics?&nbsp; As the increasing gap between the wealthy and everyone else drives our economies to the brink, what are the forces—the many small forces—that drive us back from the edge?&nbsp; Viewing economics as a complex system of differential equations is actually an oversimplification.&nbsp; Can we observe the many factors that line up (and in many countries, have lined up) to give people voices and choices about their future?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For COVID-19 and all the problems we’re facing, that’s the real work, the hard work that can’t wait for the modelling to be done.&nbsp; What are the many causes that will provide a push in the right direction? We don’t need definitive answers before taking steps.&nbsp; Once we take those first steps–whether it’s wearing masks or demilitarizing police forces or providing universal healthcare–it will become more evident what works, what doesn’t,&nbsp; and what the next steps are. And we might discover that effective solutions aren’t as difficult or as distant as they seem.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/NYmOQu_GakQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/covid-19-and-complex-systems/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/covid-19-and-complex-systems/'}, {'title': 'Four short links: 24 June 2020', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Four short links: 24 June 2020'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/Yl1efm15k3I/'}], 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/Yl1efm15k3I/', 'comments': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/four-short-links-24-june-2020/#respond', 'published': 'Wed, 24 Jun 2020 11:38:25 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2020, tm_mon=6, tm_mday=24, tm_hour=11, tm_min=38, tm_sec=25, tm_wday=2, tm_yday=176, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Nat Torkington'}], 'author': 'Nat Torkington', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Nat Torkington'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Four Short Links', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Signals', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/?p=13031', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'You&#8217;ve Been Referred Here Because You&#8217;re Wrong About Section 230 Of The Communications Decency Act &#8212; Really good mythbusting piece about Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (the piece of legislation that places the liability for online content upon the whoever created the content, not on whoever is hosting it).

At the blackjack table, Mike gets dealt an 11 and Trent tells him to double down. Mike responds “What?!” and Trent replies “Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.” Mike doubles down and loses the hand. The next scene opens with:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Trent: I&#8217;m telling you, baby, you <em>always</em> double down on an eleven.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Mike: Yeah? Well obviously not <em>always</em>!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Trent: <em>Always</em>, baby.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Mike: I&#8217;m just saying, not in this particular case.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Trent: <em>Always</em>.<br><br>Mike: But I lost! How can you say <em>always</em>?!?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Mike had made the common error of equating a <em>bad outcome</em> with a <em>bad decision</em>. The decision-making process was fine. We know, statistically, that doubling down on an 11 is a good (and common) strategy in blackjack. But when making a decision under uncertainty about the future, two things dictate the outcome: (1) the quality of the decision and (2) chance. The quality of the decision is based on known information and an informed risk assessment, while chance involves hidden information and the stochasticity of the world. The latter resulted in Mike losing his blackjack hand. It was luck, not the decision to double down.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We currently have a lot of serious and challenging decisions to make at personal, societal, and global levels and none of them are as simple as a game of blackjack. This essay is about how to take a more principled approach to making decisions under uncertainty and aims to provide certain conceptual and cognitive tools for how to do so, not what decisions to make. These tools include how to:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Think probabilistically and understand the nature of predictions.</li><li>Consider risk not only in terms of likelihood but also in terms of the impact of your decisions.</li><li>Interrogate reported data and information with a healthy skepticism through thinking about the processes that generate the data.</li><li>Prioritize which decisions to make and what actions to take in an uncertain world.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are two key differences between the type of decisions we need to make currently and Mike’s decision to double down in blackjack. Firstly, in cases such as re-opening economies, the decision space isn’t binary\\u2060—it’s not “re-open the economy or not,” it’s “how? how much? when? and how do we know when to reel it back in?” Secondly, we know the odds in blackjack—it will take you some time, but you can write down a table of all the probabilities. When we know the probabilities of the important variables but don’t know the outcomes, it’s called <em>risk</em>. When we don’t know the probabilities, or even what all the important variables are, it’s called <em>uncertainty</em>. Recognizing the difference between risk and uncertainty is essential to knowing when you can and cannot completely calculate and assess risk. Thinking how to assess decision quality, as opposed to outcome quality, in both cases is key, though, as <em>Swingers </em>makes clear.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/552885/thinking-in-bets-by-annie-duke/\">Thinking in Bets</a></em>, Annie Duke’s 2018 book about making decisions under uncertainty, has many analogous examples operating under both risk and uncertainty, such as the infamous 2015 Super Bowl XLIX Seahawks’ decision to pass the ball in the final 26 seconds. The pass was intercepted, the Seahawks lost, and we saw countless headlines such as &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/super-bowl-seattle-seahawks-pete-carroll-darrell-bevell-russell-wilson-dumbest-call-ever-020215\">Dumbest Call in Super Bowl History Could Be Beginning of the End for Seattle Seahawks</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/seahawks/seahawks-lost-because-of-the-worst-call-in-super-bowl-history/\">Seahawks Lost Because of the Worst Call in Super Bowl History</a>.&#8221; As Duke astutely points out, agreeing with several commentators such as FiveThirtyEight’s <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-head-coach-botched-the-end-of-the-super-bowl-and-it-wasnt-pete-carroll/\">Benjamin Morris</a> and Slate’s <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2015/02/why-pete-carrolls-decision-to-pass-wasnt-the-worst-play-call-ever.html\">Brian Burke</a>, the decision to pass was eminently defensible, as “in the previous fifteen seasons, the interception rate in that situation was about 2%.” Tellingly, when Duke asks business executives to write down their best and worst decisions of the past year, they invariably write down the best and worst outcomes. It is all too human to judge decisions by their outcomes. Duke refers to this as <em>resulting</em>. We need to rationally decouple decision quality from outcome quality. One challenge is that we are evaluated on outcomes, not decisions, for the most part: a Chief Sales Officer is evaluated on deals closed and annual recurring revenue, not the decisions they make, per se. The success of a company is likewise determined by outcome quality, not decision quality. However, as with blackjack, if we are to evaluate decision making by looking at outcomes, it is more productive to look at the long run frequencies of good and bad outcomes to evaluate both the decision and the strategy that led to the decision. In the long run, the fluctuations of chance will average out.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another key barrier to rationally evaluating decision quality is that we are not adept at dealing with uncertainty and thinking probabilistically. We saw this after the 2016 U.S. Presidential election when people said the pollsters’ predictions were wrong, because they had Clinton as the front-runner. But a prediction that Clinton had a 90% chance of winning was not an incorrect prediction, even when Trump won: Trump winning was merely that 10% chance playing out in reality. The statement “the prediction was wrong” is assessing the quality of the prediction based on the outcome, committing the same error as assessing the quality of a decision based on outcome: it’s <em>resulting</em>. For this reason, let’s drill down a bit into how bad we really are at thinking probabilistically and dealing with uncertainty. To do so, let’s stick with the example of the&nbsp;2016 U.S. election.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Making Predictions and Thinking Probabilistically</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Many intelligent people were surprised when Donald Trump won the presidency, even though FiveThiryEight gave him a 29% chance of winning. Allen Downey, Professor at Olin College, <a href=\"http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2016/11/why-are-we-so-surprised.html\">points out</a> that a 29% chance is more likely than seeing two heads when flipping two coins (25% chance), an occurrence that wouldn’t surprise any of us. Even if we believed the forecasts that gave Trump a 10% chance of winning, this is just slightly less likely than seeing three heads in three coin tosses (12.5%), which also would not&nbsp; surprise many people. Consider a 10% likelihood in this way: “would you board a plane if the pilot told you it had a 90% chance of landing successfully?”, as Nate Silver asks in <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/305826/the-signal-and-the-noise-by-nate-silver/\"><em>The Signal and the Noise</em></a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Why are we so bad at interpreting probabilistic predictions, such as the probability of Trump winning the presidency? One possibility, suggested by Downey, is that we generally interpret probabilistic predictions as deterministic predictions with a particular degree of certainty. For example, “Clinton has a 90% chance of winning” would be interpreted as “The poll says Clinton will win and we’re 90% sure of this.” As Downey says, “If you think the outcome means that the prediction was wrong, that suggests you are treating the prediction as deterministic.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Forecasters and pollsters are aware of this deep challenge. Nate Silver and FiveThirtyEight have put substantial thought into how to report their probabilistic forecasts. In the 2018 midterms, for example, they <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/senate/\">began to make forecasts such</a> as “1 in 5 chance Democrats win control (19.1%); 4 in 5 chance Republicans keep control (80.9%),” which is careful to express the probabilistic nature of the prediction. I recalled this mindful use of language when I recently had a COVID-19 test and the doctor reported “the test did not detect the presence of COVID-19,” instead of “the test came back negative.” Language is important, particularly in situations where our intuition doesn’t work well, such as in probabilistic forecasts and data reporting. So knowing that we need to make sure we judge decision and prediction quality based on what was known at the time of decision or prediction, respectively, how do we go about thinking through the risks to make decisions in the first place?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Risk, Probability, Impact, and Decisions</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I’ve had many discussions around risk assessment and decision-making with respect to COVID-19, as we likely all have recently. One common and concerning throughline is that many people appear to make risk assessments based on likelihood without considering impact. For example, in different conversations, I told several friends that my COVID-19 test had come back negative. Each friend replied along similar lines, saying that it meant that I could visit my parents, who are both in high risk groups. Ignoring the false negative rate, I replied that it would still be possible for me to pick up COVID-19 after the test and take it into their house, and my friends’ responses were all “but it is<em> soooo</em><strong> </strong>unlikely<strong>.</strong>” This may be true, but the downside risk in this case could be fatal. When making decisions under uncertainty, it is a mistake to consider likelihood alone: you need to consider impact.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For example, let’s say there’s a burger that you’ve heard is great and you really want to try it. If there’s a 20% chance that it will give you some mild stomach trouble (possible but low impact), perhaps you’ll still try it. If there’s a 0.1% (1 in 1,000) chance that it will kill you (very unlikely but high impact), I’d be surprised and/or concerned if you decided to eat it, after assessing the risk.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This example, although a bit silly (and perhaps delicious), has many elements of what you need to make decisions under uncertainty: consideration of likelihood of different potential outcomes, upside risk (enjoying a delicious burger), and downside risk (stomach trouble and dying, respectively).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Now imagine a different scenario. Instead of eating a burger, we&#8217;re talking about surgery to cure a painful but not life-threatening condition, spine surgery, for example, and there is a 0.1% chance of death. The downside risk is the same, fatal, but the upside risk is a lot more impactful than eating a burger, so there’s an increased chance of you taking on the downside risk.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Instead of viewing a risk assessment along the sole axis of likelihood, we also have to consider impact. One useful tool for doing this is known as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_matrix\">risk matrix</a> (common in business settings), a table that has axes likelihood and impact:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/likelihoodVseverity.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12994\" srcset=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/likelihoodVseverity.png 631w, https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/likelihoodVseverity-300x252.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px\" /><figcaption><br>This risk matrix captures the likelihood of outcome on the vertical axis and the impact on the horizontal axis and is based on a risk matrix from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_matrix\">Wikipedia page</a>. It references decisions described in the main body of the essay and it does not describe the upside risk in these situations (which would require a third dimension!)</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Deciding whether to wear a mask outside is a current example. There are multiple personal and societal risks to consider: wearing a mask reduces the transmission of COVID-19 (upside risk; particularly important given the risk of being an asymptomatic transmission vector) but if we all go out and panic buy PPE masks, there will be a devastating lack of supply for frontline healthcare workers (downside risk; note that the risk is <em>not </em>for us, but for frontline healthcare workers and, by extension, society, so in this case we’re thinking about making individual decisions based around societal, not only personal, risk). Once you realize that we can all avoid the downside risk by <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html\">making masks from household items</a> or buying cotton masks online from dressmakers and shirtmakers, the decision to wear a mask is a no-brainer.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This example also illustrates how the decision space can be a lot larger than originally envisioned: the choice is not merely between “wearing a mask that a doctor or nurse will need” or “not.” There are always more options than are first apparent. Our work is to find the ones that minimize risk. We saw this play out as the CDC and many governments went from recommending only people who have symptoms wear masks to recommending that everybody wear masks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is a guide for how to think about making decisions, not what decisions to make. The decisions any individual makes are also a function of how risk-friendly and risk-averse that individual is. Financial advisors are known to provide questionnaires to determine where their clients lie on the risk friendliness-aversion spectrum and advise accordingly. I am generally risk friendly but, when it comes to a global pandemic and matters of life and death, I am highly risk averse. I would encourage you to be also, and remind you that your actions impact potentially a huge number of people, even if you are in a low risk group and not particularly concerned about your own health.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>At a far larger scale of decision-making, governments need to make decisions around when and how to re-open economies. They need to consider a number of things. In particular, the fact that we have a public health crisis <em>and</em> a resulting economic crisis, which feeds back into the public health crisis, along with creating its own health crises, which economic downturns are known to. Ideally, we could re-open the economy to an extent that will not exacerbate the COVID-19 crisis but enough to reduce the economic crisis and all the downstream effects. This is once again opening up the decision space: it isn’t “re-open the economy or not”; it’s figuring out when to and by how much.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Figuring out likelihoods and impact of all our governmental decisions is incredibly challenging work. It’s the same on a personal level. We need to consider both the likelihood of outcomes resulting from our different decisions, along with their impact, but how can we actually do this? Having good quality information is key, as is knowing what our blind spots are, that is, knowing what we don’t know. So let’s now dive into thinking about the quality of the data we’re seeing every day, and what type of information and knowledge we can extract from it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Data, Information, Knowledge, and Decision-Making</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the most important steps in acknowledging what our blind spots are is knowing the limitations of the data and information that we receive.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For example, when we see a chart of the number of reported cases of&nbsp; COVID-19 over time, it is natural and tempting to think of this as a proxy for the evolution of the number of <em>actual cases</em>. I’ve heard rational humans make statements such as “it may not be quite right, but it’s all we have and probably captures the trend.” But it may not even do that. The <em>number of reported cases </em>is a function of many things, including the number of tests available, the willingness of people to be tested, the willingness of any particular government to report their findings, and a time lag resulting from the COVID-19 incubation period. In terms of government incentives to report their findings, it is key to keep front of mind that the reporting of a COVID death is a political <em>and </em>politicized act. There has been huge skepticism of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/china-denies-cover-up-as-wuhan-coronavirus-deaths-revised-up-50\">official counts coming out of China</a> and, as we re-open cities across the world, governments will be incentivized to under-report cases, both to justify the decisions to re-open and in the name of protecting economies.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In terms of the number of reported cases being a function of the number of available tests, take this extreme limit case: one day, there are no tests, so <em>no reported cases</em>, and the next day there are a huge number of tests; in this case, even if there were a decrease in the total number of <em>actual cases</em>, a huge spike would be reported.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a real-world example, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1241113755016138755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">Nate Silver reported</a>:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Washington State is a good example of the importance of accounting for the number of tests when reporting COVID-19 case counts. Remember I mentioned a couple of days ago how their number of cases in WA had begun to stabilize? Well, guess what happened… Today, <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/data/state/washington\">they reported</a> 189 positives, along with 175 yesterday, as compared with an average of 106 positives per day in the 7 days before that. So, not great on the surface&#8230; new cases increased by 70%! But you also have to look at the number of tests. Washington conducted 3,607 tests today and 2,976 yesterday. By comparison, they&#8217;d conducted an average of 1,670 tests in the 7 days before that. So they&#8217;ve increased testing capacity by 97% over their baseline. Meanwhile, detected cases have increased, but by &#8220;only&#8221; 70%. Looked at another way: Today, 5.2% of Washington&#8217;s tests came up with a positive result. Yesterday, 5.9% did. In the 7 days before that, 6.4% of them did. So, there *is* a bit of progress after all. Their number of new positives *as a share of new tests* is slightly declining. For the time being, 1) the large (perhaps very large) majority of coronavirus positives are undetected and 2) test capacity is ramping up at extremely fast rates, far faster than coronavirus itself would spread even under worst-case assumptions. So long as those two things hold, the rate of increase in the number of *detected* cases is primarily a function of the rate of increase in the number of *tests* and does not tell us that much about how fast the actual *infection* is spreading.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Silver went on to write <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/\">an article</a> entitled “Coronavirus Case Counts Are Meaningless” with a subtitle “Unless you know something about testing. And even then, it gets complicated.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In a similar manner, the number of <em>reported deaths </em>is also likely to be a serious underestimate, because,&nbsp; in many places, to be a reported COVID-19 death, you need to be tested and diagnosed. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-01/coronavirus-italy-shows-we-may-be-underestimating-death-toll\">Bloomberg reports</a> that, in reference to Italy, “many will die in their houses or nursing homes and may not even be counted as COVID-19 cases unless they’re tested post-mortem.” As Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the top US government infectious disease experts and member of 45’s COVID-19 task force, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/12/fauci-puts-it-bluntly-coronavirus-deaths-are-undercounted/\">stated</a>, “there may have been people who died at home who did have COVID, who are not counted as COVID because they never really got to the hospital.” It is important to stress that this undercounting will disproportionately impact demographics that have less wealth and less access to healthcare, including those already structurally oppressed, such as people of color. One way to correct for this bias in the data is to look at the <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid\">statistics of “excess deaths,”</a> the numbers when compared with previous years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A conceptual tool that I like to use when thinking about these types of biases in the data collection and data reporting processes is Wittgenstein’s Ruler, as introduced by essayist, statistician, and professional provocateur Nassim Nicholas Taleb in <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/176225/fooled-by-randomness-by-nassim-nicholas-taleb/\">Fooled By Randomness</a>:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Unless you have confidence in the ruler’s reliability, if you use a ruler to measure a table you may also be using the table to measure the ruler.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The first concept here is that, if your measurement device is broken, whether it be a ruler or a pandemic testing system, it’s not telling you anything of value about the real world. Worse, it may be providing incorrect information. The second concept is that, if you can find out something about the length of the table by other means, you may be able to infer properties of the ruler. In our current case, this could mean that if we knew more about <em>actual death rate</em> (by, for example, considering the statistics of “excess deaths”), we could infer the flaws in our <em>reported deaths </em>data collection, analysis, and reporting processes.<sup>1</sup></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Moreover, data collection and data reporting are political acts and processes embedded in societies with asymmetric power relations, and most often processes controlled by those in positions of power. In the words of Catherine D&#8217;Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein in <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/data-feminism\"><em>Data Feminism</em></a>, “governments and corporations have long employed data and statistics as management techniques to preserve and unequal status quo.” It is a revelation to realize that the etymology of the word <em>statistics </em>comes from the term <em>statecraft</em><sup>2</sup> and the ability of states and governments to wield power through the control of data collection and data reporting (they decide what is collected, reported, how it is reported, and what decisions are made).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The major takeaway from this section is to approach reported data with an educated skepticism, recognize the potential biases in reported data, and realize that there is a huge amount of uncertainty here. Easier said than done, of course, particularly when we live in a world of information glut and the sheer number of decisions we need to make seems to increase daily. So how do we actually think about incorporating information into our decision-making processes? And how do we prioritize which decisions to make and actions to take?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Information Anxiety, Decision Fatigue, and the Scale of Things</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In <em>The Signal and the Noise</em>, Nate Silver points out that we’re drowning in information and “we think we want information when we really want knowledge.” What we really now need is knowledge, which involves understanding, and an ability to incorporate this knowledge into our decision-making processes.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The number of decisions that a modern human has to make daily, consciously or otherwise, is staggering: <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/stretching-theory/201809/how-many-decisions-do-we-make-each-day\">estimates are around 35,000</a>. Decision fatigue is real when one is faced with too many decisions, one after the other. Decision paralysis and the tyranny of choice<sup>3</sup> are real, particularly in light of the vast swathes of content on display in the marketplace of the attention economy. This is why terms such as information anxiety, infobesity, and infoxication have evolved. And this was all pre-COVID-19.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Now we have a huge number of potentially fatal decisions to make and information to take in on so many scales:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>On the nanometre scale, the size of a coronavirus particle.</li><li>On a microscale: “what did I just touch? Could I have picked up a particle?”</li><li>On a bodily scale, when touching one’s nose by accident.</li><li>On an apartment or house scale, when bringing deliveries or groceries in.</li><li>On a family, professional, and small social network scale: “Who have I interacted with?”, “Who can I interact with?”</li><li>On suburban, urban, state, national, and global scales: quarantine, lockdown, and shelter-in-place orders, supplies for hospitals, the closing of schools, shutting down the economy.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When contemplating the size of the universe in his <em>Pensees</em>, Blaise Pascal exclaimed “The eternal silence of these infinite spaces frightens me.” This would be a reasonable reaction to COVID-19, although one should also include an anxiety at the other end of the scale, the anxiety about the virus itself. From this perspective, as a global species, we’re stuck in the middle of a set of unforgiving scales that produce deep personal anxiety, global anxieties, and everything in between.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is all to say that making decisions under uncertainty is tough and we’re not great at it, even under normal circumstances. During a global pandemic, it’s infinitely more difficult. We need to prioritize the decisions we want to make such as, for example, those involving the health of ourselves and those closest to us. When there are so many decisions to make, how do you go about ranking them, in terms of prioritization? A good heuristic here is to map out the space of possibilities resulting from your decisions, a practice called <em>scenario planning</em>, and prioritizing the ones that have the largest potential impact. In <em>Thinking in Bets</em>, Duke provides the example of After-School All-Stars (ASAS), a national non-profit she consulted. ASAS needed to prioritize the grants they were applying for. They had been prioritizing those that were worth the most, even if they were very unlikely to receive them. Duke proposed prioritizing the grants with highest expected value, that is, the total award grant multiplied by the estimated probability of receiving the grant (a grant <em>X</em> of $100,000 that they would win 10% of the time would be valued at $10,000; a grant Y of $50,000 that they would win 50% of the time would be valued at $25,000; in ASAS’ prioritization scheme, <em>X</em> would be prioritized, in Duke’s, <em>Y </em>would be: it’s worth less, but five times more likely). What Duke is implicitly performing in this calculus is <em>scenario planning</em> by looking at two possible futures (“awarded” or “declined” post-application) and averaging over them with respect to the probability of each. For more on scenario planning, I encourage you to check out Peter Schwartz’ book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/Art-Long-View-Planning-Uncertain-ebook/dp/B006YYUPN8\"><em>The Art of the Long View: Planning for the Future in an Uncertain World</em></a>, along with Tim O’Reilly’s recent essay <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/tim/21stcentury/\"><em>Welcome to the 21st Century: How To Plan For The Post-Covid Future</em></a>, which “plays fast and loose with some of its ideas” (Tim’s words).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Most real-world cases are nowhere near as clean cut and consist of many cross-cutting decisions with varying levels of risk and uncertainty. However, taking a more principled approach to decision-making and prioritization by considering likelihood, impact, and scenario planning will improve decision quality. So will thinking more critically about risk, uncertainty, what the data we have actually means, and what information we really have about the world, as well as acknowledging our blind spots. In a word, making better decisions requires us to be more honest about uncertainty.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Footnotes</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><sup>1</sup> Taleb introduces the concept of Wittgenstein’s Ruler with respect to book reviews: “A book review, good or bad, can be far more descriptive of the reviewer than informational about the book itself.”</p>\\n<p><sup>2</sup> I discovered this fact from Chris Wiggins’ &amp; Matt Jones’ course <a href=\"https://data-ppf.github.io/\">data: past, present, and future</a> at Columbia University.</p>\\n<p><sup>3</sup> Also see <i>The Paradox of Choice\\u2060 — Why Less is More</i>, by Barry Schwartz, the thesis of which is that “eliminating consumer choices can greatly reduce anxiety for shoppers.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>  </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Many thanks to </em><a href=\"http://www.allendowney.com/wp/\"><em>Allen Downey</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://qethanm.cc/\"><em>Q McCallum</em></a><em> for feedback on drafts of this essay and to </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/quaesita\"><em>Cassie Kozyrkov</em></a><em> for ongoing, thoughtful, and heated conversations about the topics covered.</em></p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/QPMRmPogmfM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/decision-making-in-a-time-of-crisis/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/decision-making-in-a-time-of-crisis/'}, {'title': 'Four short links: 16 June 2020', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Four short links: 16 June 2020'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/hPl2-_04owA/'}], 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/hPl2-_04owA/', 'comments': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/four-short-links-16-june-2020/#respond', 'published': 'Tue, 16 Jun 2020 11:51:12 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2020, tm_mon=6, tm_mday=16, tm_hour=11, tm_min=51, tm_sec=12, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=168, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Nat Torkington'}], 'author': 'Nat Torkington', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Nat Torkington'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Four Short Links', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Signals', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/?p=12980', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'The Global Implications of “Re-education” Technologies in Northwest China &#8212; A great summary of the way that technology facilitates China&#8217;s Muslim “re-education” system in Northwest China.

It&#8217;s one thing to build a model; it&#8217;s another thing altogether to embody that model in an application and deploy it successfully in production.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That&#8217;s where Emmanuel Ameisen&#8217;s book, <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781492045106/\">\\xa0Building Machine Learning Applications</a>, comes in. When I first met Emmanuel, three or four years ago, what impressed me wasn&#8217;t his expertise in building models—though he clearly had that. (I first learned about Emmanuel through articles on his <a href=\"https://mlpowered.com/posts/\">\\xa0blog.</a>) He clearly cared about the whole process: not just developing algorithms, finding and cleaning data, and training models, but building a working application and putting it in production.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That&#8217;s what his new book is about. The development process doesn&#8217;t end with a model. It ends with that model that&#8217;s deployed. You can&#8217;t just talk about programming or training; you&#8217;ve got to make this work in the real world.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Emmanuel starts at the beginning: what are the goals for the product, and how do you refine those goals into something that can be reasonably implemented? You need to understand whether a problem can be solved—and if not, how to reframe the problem so that it can be. You need to define metrics that show how your system is performing, and whether you&#8217;re making progress. You need to collect relevant data for training, and deploy pipelines that will feed data to the model when it is in production. Making a product that works in the real world also includes understanding how to deploy the model; monitoring performance after deployment; and ongoing maintenance and updates.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Maintenance may be the most important issue. In the last few years, operations teams have learned a lot about continuous deployment and delivery (CI/CD). The question facing us now is how machine learning applications fit into this model. How do you monitor ML applications, and what kind of monitoring is needed? How do you detect model drift? These concepts are new to the ongoing conversation about monitoring and observability. How do you practice rapid deployment when training a model can take hours or days?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are many books out there that talk about machine learning. But this is the only one I know of that covers the entire process, end-to-end, in approachable and practical terms. It&#8217;s the only one that focuses on the biggest machine learning problem of all: getting the model off of your laptop and into production.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/hD7ZjV3u3Xg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/machine-learning-and-the-production-gap/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/machine-learning-and-the-production-gap/'}, {'title': 'Four short links: 9 June 2020', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Four short links: 9 June 2020'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/_25WUVDyRUQ/'}], 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/_25WUVDyRUQ/', 'comments': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/four-short-links-9-june-2020/#respond', 'published': 'Tue, 09 Jun 2020 10:58:27 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2020, tm_mon=6, tm_mday=9, tm_hour=10, tm_min=58, tm_sec=27, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=161, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Nat Torkington'}], 'author': 'Nat Torkington', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Nat Torkington'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Four Short Links', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Signals', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/?p=12962', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'Anti-Monopoly Thinking &#8212; Tim Bray reviews &#8220;The Myth of Capitalism: Monopolies and the Death of Competition&#8221; by Jonathan Tepper and Denise Hearn.

I’ll reproduce the thread here, with Nat Torkington’s comments.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>First, I’d like to start with some background. The behavior of major cloud companies, such as Amazon, has increasingly stirred up angst and fear in open source companies.&nbsp; These companies provide (and support) software that anyone can download, install, and use for free. There are often commercially licensed add-ons around the open core.&nbsp; Amazon and other cloud providers have taken the free software without paying (after all, it’s free, that’s the point), and offer it in their commercial cloud products “as a service.” There’s nothing in the license to prevent this; after all, you can download and run the software without charge.&nbsp; It’s more free than beer; after all, you wouldn’t leave a party with a keg to sell on the street corner.&nbsp; The cloud providers have the technical capabilities to run and support the software at scale, so they have no need to buy services from companies like Chef (or Puppet, or Elastic, or MongoDB, or DataStax, or…), and in many cases they have the ability to build their own versions of the open source company’s proprietary add-ons. The result is that they are taking away market share without contributing anything in return.&nbsp; Stephen O’Grady has a good (and much more detailed) <a href=\"https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2019/03/15/cloud-open-source-powder-keg/\">summary</a> of the problem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Many open source companies have responded with changes to their licensing and distribution models.&nbsp; And many of these changes are, essentially, making the software less “open.”&nbsp; Elastic, for example, distributes ElasticSearch (open source core) with proprietary components; ElasticSearch itself is free software, but to use their distribution legally, you have to untangle it from the proprietary components–not a simple task.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Chef has gone in the other direction.&nbsp; Just over a year ago, they <a href=\"https://blog.chef.io/chef-software-announces-the-enterprise-automation-stack/\">doubled down on open source</a>; as of April 2, 2019, all software development is under the Apache 2.0 license.&nbsp; You can download their software, use it, contribute to it, and even redistribute it or turn it into a service on your cloud platform, all for free.&nbsp; There is one catch: Chef is a trademark, and you do not get the rights to the trademark.&nbsp; You can redistribute the software, but you can’t call it Chef.&nbsp; This model is comparable to Red Hat’s: all of their software is open source, under the GNU Public License. You can use it to make your own distribution, but you can’t redistribute it and call it Red Hat.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And this is where it gets really interesting.&nbsp; Adam Jacob has been doing a lot of writing about <a href=\"https://sfosc.org/docs/book/\">sustainable free and open source communities</a>: what does a community mean? Under what rules should it operate if it’s going to be healthy and meet the needs of its members?&nbsp; A community under which “freedom’s just another word for nothing left to lose” isn’t a community that’s meeting the needs of its members.&nbsp; Given his focus on open source communities, it’s not surprising that Adam supports Chef’s decision, though he left Chef before that decision was made.&nbsp; In this thread, he talks about why that decision was important and what it takes to build a healthy business around open source software. Here’s Adam (with my annotations and Nat’s comments):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">For people wondering if switching to the red hat model has worked for chef &#8211; super yes.

The first story an algorithm told about me was that my life was in danger. It was 7:53 pm on a clear Monday evening in September of 1981, at the Columbia Hospital for Women in Washington DC. I was exactly one minute old. The medical team scored me—as it does for nearly all of the 98% of American newborns who arrive in hospitals—using a ten-point scale known as the Apgar, a simple algorithm based on direct observations of newborn health. (You get two points for waving your arms and legs, for instance.) My exact score is lost to history, but one of the doctors in the room tells me it was probably a six or less out of ten. Numbers like that typically mean a baby needs help. Whether driven by my score, or by their own firsthand experience, the doctors sent me straight to the neonatal intensive care ward, where I spent my first few days. I lived in a clear incubator, basking under a warming light like a very well oxygenated burrito.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Doctors and nurses have always cared about whether newborns are healthy. But before Virginia Apgar introduced her numerical scale in 1953, doctors varied widely in their treatment of vulnerable newborns. Using the new scores, Apgar and her colleagues proved that many infants who initially seemed lifeless could be revived, with success or failure in each case measured by the difference between an Apgar score at one minute after birth, and a second score taken at five minutes. Standard measures made systematic knowledge about infants’ welfare possible, and also simplified decision making about what to do in the urgent first moments after a difficult birth. The algorithm does have its limits: It’s partly subjective, and Apgar warned that because the doctor who delivers a baby is “inevitably emotionally involved,” someone else should do the scoring. More importantly, while a low score nearly always means the infant needs help, the converse isn’t true—some newborns who are in trouble nonetheless get high scores. An Apgar score is a tiny story, easily made and compared. It’s very often useful, but it isn’t always right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Most algorithms in the news these days are calculated by software. But an algorithm is just a rule expressed in numbers, and there’s no hard line separating simple rules of thumb like the Apgar from the most complex mathematical formulas.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When an algorithm describes a human being—no matter how complex or simple the math may be—the goal is to distill something essential and true, something <em>usable </em>and standardized, out of the mess of unique circumstances that make up each human life. And yet a number or category label that describes a human life is not only machine-readable data. It is also a story, one that can live vividly in the mind and imagination of the person being scored, as well as the minds of others who sit in judgment. Sometimes, as with the Apgar, the score has a clear, limited purpose and does its job well.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But there’s often a gap between how much of a person’s story an algorithm can tell, and how much we want it to tell.&nbsp; The temptation to ignore that gap, or to jump across it through wishful thinking, can be overwhelming.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Reading the numbers in a California classroom</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To see this up close, consider the scores we give to older kids in classrooms. A friend of mine, who I’ll call Audrey, teaches sixth grade on California’s central coast. I visited her brightly lit classroom recently over a school break. The chairs and tables were low and kid-sized, so that walking in at adult height, I had the disorienting feeling of becoming a slightly larger version of myself. Below the windows on one long side of the room sat books in colorful bins—hundreds of them, a class library. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Under school district policy, each of Audrey’s eleven- and twelve-year old students is tested at least three times a year to determine his or her Lexile, a number between 200 and 1,700 that reflects how well the student can read. Books, in turn, get matching scores to reflect their difficulty. Some students ignore these numbers, Audrey tells me, but for others, their personal score can be a big deal: Some are proud to be officially scored as a precocious reader, and others feel badly when their score tags them as behind the curve. These scores go on student report cards, and are a frequent topic at parent-teacher conferences. Earlier this year, Audrey got permission from one of her students to tell the whole class that his score had improved by more than 200 points, and they all applauded.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But Audrey tells me that these Lexile numbers don’t really tell the whole story of who’s a good reader. They test each student’s grasp of a particular sentence or paragraph—but not of a whole story. Some of the students who ace this test still struggle to discuss a book in class, while others who prepare well for discussion, and think deeply about what they’ve read, still earn low scores.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Sixth graders are on the cusp of becoming truly independent learners. “This is kind of the last shot I’ve got,” Audrey tells me, “to get [the students] to feel like they can own books, and discuss and analyze books, and really think deeply about them. And that, to my mind, is more important than just reading a short amount of text and answering a question.” She wants to build confidence and skill in her students, especially the ones who struggle—and she worries that a low score could become a self-fulfilling, discouraging prophecy. Each of the classroom’s library books has a color coded sticker on its spine reflecting <em>its </em>Lexile score—a visual announcement of its official complexity level, and&nbsp; thus of which students might be officially ready to read it. Audrey knows it would be easy for kids to feel ashamed to be in the same simple category as the easiest books, so she makes sure to to add some thick, imposing chapter books at the less advanced levels, and some thinner books at the more advanced categories.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This whole scoring system also changes the story about who librarians and teachers are. In 2001, just as the Lexile system was rolling out state-wide, a professor of education named Stephen Krashen took to the pages of the California School Library Journal to raise an alarm. It’s a core role of librarians and teachers to know their students and to recommend interesting books, he wrote. The best book for a given student may be very easy for them to read, or might be more advanced than they find comfortable, depending on topic. The larger problem is that many students simply don’t have “good books and a comfortable place to read them.”&nbsp; But the Lexile system’s inventor, A. Jackson Stenner, disagreed, and cast the role of educators in far more mechanical terms.&nbsp; He suggested that “inattention to targeting” books based on reading level “is the single best explanation for why students don’t read more.” His system was needed because “beginning teachers and librarians” were less expert at “forecasting comprehension rates” than the algorithm was. But one might equally wonder what made this computational task, at which the new algorithm happened to excel, a good yardstick for judging teachers? If you accept this mechanism for judging reading ability, you’re implicitly accepting a much more mechanical role for teachers: hand out books according to the numbers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Heart surgeons, by the numbers</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Other stories get distorted in similar ways, even when the people being described by an algorithm are a small and elite group. There are about 150 cardiac surgeons in New York State, for instance. Ever since 1989, the state has periodically published a report card that rates each surgeon, by name, based on how many of that surgeon’s patients died in hospital or within 30 days after coronary artery bypass surgery. Of course, these mortality numbers depend in part on each surgeon’s patient mix: those who operate on sicker patients can expect more deaths, even if they are equally (or more) skilled. So the state calculates and publishes a “Risk Adjusted Mortality Ratio”—a comparison between the actual number of observed deaths and the number that would be statistically expected, on average, for patients medically similar to those each doctor actually operated on. This process controls for prior heart attacks, age, and several other factors, though, of course, it can’t cover everything. The <a href=\"https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/diseases/cardiovascular/heart_disease/docs/2014-2016_adult_cardiac_surgery.pdf\">report</a> has pages of careful caveats, but in the end it treats these risk-adjusted ratios as a good measure of a surgeon’s performance. Ratios much less than one mean “the provider has significantly better performance than the state as a whole,” and conversely, ratios larger than one mean worse performance.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These report cards have changed the way that cardiac surgeons in New York do their jobs, but thirty years on, it’s still not clear whether the metrics make things better. A few surgeons, who did few heart surgeries and had below-average performance, stopped doing these surgeries when reporting began, which is perhaps a credit to the system. But report cards also seem to make even great surgeons more cautious than they think is best for their patients. In a 1997 survey of all New York heart surgeons,&nbsp; most respondents said they had “refused to operate on at least one high risk patient” within the last year “primarily due to public reporting.” The expected fatality rate after cardiac surgery is low—just 1.67% at last count—which is good, but leaves surgeons with little room to take chances. Inevitably, patients with risk factors that are excluded from the model’s adjustments present a threat to each surgeon’s statistics. At the Mayo Clinic, whose Cleveland location puts it 110-miles west of the New York state line, scholars noted a 31% increase in heart surgery patients coming over from New York after the report cards began. They concluded that “out-of-state risk-shifting appears to be a significant by-product of report-card medicine,” and warned that if Ohio adopted a similar system, patients might find it even harder to get needed surgeries. Surgeons also worry that the system discourages new approaches to hard cases, which carry more risk but could also be good for patients.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Mass produced and farm-to-table</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Looking at these three examples side by side—algorithms that judge newborns, young readers, and cardiac surgeons—I find myself reminded of those dehydrated meals you can take on a camping trip. There might have been a bunch of complex fresh ingredients at the beginning, but they get reduced to something small and portable and shelf-stable, something easy to manage. “Just add hot water,” say the instructions. But when you heat it up again, you never quite get the same meal back. Like hot water applied to a dehydrated meal, algorithms applied to data about people can quickly give us something that’s simple, consistent, and easy to use. The score an algorithm calculates about a person isn’t their real story, any more than a foil bag of reconstituted noodles is a gourmet feast.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But that isn’t the whole story about algorithms; the analogy is useful, but incomplete. Yes, algorithms can distort our beliefs about who’s doing well in the classroom, or what it even <em>means </em>to be a good student or teacher. But “dehydrated stories” also produce the kind of quick comparisons that may have helped to save my newborn life. And when used well, they can do much more.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tell people’s stories through numbers, and collective identities and trends can swim into view. An unemployment rate comes from the dehydrated story of people who are looking for work, and haven’t found it yet. Likewise, the civil rights groups who fight against racially biased data in courtroom algorithms, for instance, aren’t opposed to all algorithms. They’re ardently in favor of a comprehensive and accurate census count. Census data gives a map of unmet needs, and can also point out discriminatory patterns. Stories rendered into data make discrimination visible, and make remedies possible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the 2008 financial crisis, for instance, Wells Fargo bank staff were “steering” some black borrowers toward costly subprime mortgages, even when those borrowers had sterling credit, and would have qualified for a mortgage on far more favorable terms. How did investigators know that black borrowers really were getting worse loans than their histories should have earned them? Credit scores. Federal prosecutors showed that black borrowers got worse loan terms than white borrowers with the same scores—even though they posed the same risk of default for the bank. Wells Fargo eventually<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-reaches-settlement-wells-fargo-resulting-more-175-million-relief\"> settled</a> the case for $175 million, much of it earmarked to go back to the black borrowers whose scores showed that had been saddled with overpriced loans.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Stories that come out of an algorithm depend on simplified, numerical reflections of the endless variety of human experience. These stories will never be as rich or real as the ones we learn firsthand.&nbsp; In some sense, this means that criticizing algorithms will always be easy. There will always be&nbsp; some newborns who need intensive care despite scoring high on the Apgar, some sixth graders who do well on the reading test without really mastering the skills that the test is meant to measure, and some driven cardiac surgeons whose high post-surgical fatality rates reflect an intrepid willingness to take on the hardest cases. Every time we let an algorithm tell a person’s story by distilling it down to numbers, we’re losing much of what is best about that story, most engaging, most human.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet the simplicity and predictably of algorithm-based stories can also be radically empowering. People (and organizations) often need to understand each other beyond the scale of a village—to understand something important about a distant, unfamiliar stranger, without the benefit of first-hand interaction. Economic, social, and political opportunity can also be conveyed at a distance, as the present moment of pandemic-driven remote work is forcing many of us to discover. The world would be a narrower, more parochial and less appetizing place, if the only food that we could eat were home-cooked or farm to table.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>We need both kinds of stories</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We need both kinds of stories—the gourmet farm-to-table kind, and the shelf-stable, industrialized, comparison-ready kind.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Admitting this opens up a raft of harder questions. When and why is this algorithmic bargain of simplification and standardization really worth its cost? How can those costs be minimized? If we have to choose between mechanical and personal stories, how should <em>that </em>be done—mechanically, with numerical pros and cons, or personally, with a holistic sense of what’s best in a situation?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There’s also a human and personal challenge here for each of us. We’ve got to learn to mind the gap between real stories and the ones told by data—to learn when, for both personal and organizational reasons, it’s necessary to see what the algorithms obscure. The more we work with algorithms, the more urgent and important our complementary, direct access to each others’ human stories becomes.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If you only have the numbers, you’re likely to be missing something important. Researchers have long sought ways to record and share the human context that surrounds high stakes algorithms. Google’s <a href=\"https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/about\">Model Cards</a>, for instance, include discussion in plain language about the tradeoffs engineers had to make when designing a system. In the one for their Perspective algorithm—a tool for deciding which comments in an online discussion are “toxic”—&nbsp;they warn people not to use the system for <a href=\"https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi/blob/master/2-api/model-cards/English/toxicity.md#character-judgement\">character judgment</a>. This seems like a useful direction, but careful labeling is at best an incomplete solution.
